He said “don’t go places where people hit you.” In the context of teaching us Aikido, he meant to position your body in a way that makes it difficult or impossible for an attacker to strike you. However, at the end of class, he would often give a short lecture about how the concept can also be applied to ones life.\n\nThe way he boiled it down was that fighting is an expression of powerless rage. It is a symptom of poor decision making and tragic circumstances. People leading thoughtful, productive, and fulfilling lives are not getting in fights. They are not overly concerned with personal safety as a day to day worry.\n\nIf you find yourself in a situation where you are regularly concerned for your safety, any type of self-defense technique you learn is only going to be a band-aid trying to cover up a larger problem. Rather than worry about how you are going to win the next fight, you need to worry about how you are going to change your life so that there won’t be a next fight. \n\nTake another route home from school. Stop hanging out with people who get you in trouble. Stop going to bars or clubs if you keep getting in fights. Or maybe keep going, but don’t drink so much. Try to eat healthier. Get some exercise. Get more sleep. Drink more water. Give your mind and body the tools to make good decisions.\n\nHow is work? Are you getting enough hours? Are you making enough money? Do you need to go back to school? If you’ve got time for fighting, you’ve got time for learning. \n\nOf course, everyone has circumstances beyond their control. It is a lot easier to comment on reddit about improving ones life than it is to actually do it. But the point he was trying to make is that you should not accept that you are powerless to make your own decisions about your own life and safety. A good decision you make today, no matter how small, can have consequences that affect your entire life. And that goes double for a bad decision. Even one fight can fuck up or even end your life.

That groin, nose, testicle thing is horrible advice that they don't even teach anymore. \n\nThe leg of your dominant hand 6 inches back, feet shoulder length apart, hands held with knuckles touching your cheeks and elbows in. That's your stance. Don't lift your feet, but pivot them 45 degrees when you throw a punch (same foot as the hand you're throwing, you want to feel the entire side of your body that's throwing pivot, this is where a majority of a punches' power comes from). After each punch return your knuckles to your cheek before throwing the next. While throwing a punch focus on keeping your wrist straight like your forarm is a  metal pole - don't do this your wrist is broken. Stay tight. Someone dives in for a takedown shoot your legs back and put your weight on them. Throw elbows any and all opportunities. \n\nEdit: Guess I'll continue adding because I left a lot out, there's lots to include. \n\nYou want to keep equal weight on both feet, don't put all your weight on one leg - if that's lifted you lose all balance. Have the foot of your dominant hand (which should be back) with your toes pointing to either 2 or 3 O'clock.  If someone aims for a body blow lower your forearm (which should be touching your body if your knuckles are properly placed) AND head as your knuckles never leave your cheeks. When you throw a punch you will really REALLY want to lean forward or backwards - no not do this. Biggest indicator that someone doesn't know what they're doing. If you do this you cannot move your feet at all or pivot properly thus losing all power. In terms of movement you should be doing a shuffle step - step with one foot and lightly drag the other. Feels weird, especially keeping your stance (dominant hands foot 6 inches back + shoulder length apart). When you step your feet will be slightly more than shoulder length, shouldnt be more than 3 inches. You go left move the left foot first. You go right move your right foot. NEVER cross your legs. Bigger people hit harder because they have an easier time putting mass into the hit, the same thing can be accomplished with pivoting your body appropriately. People get knocked out not by the force of the hit but the jaring in their brain, which is why you see videos of someone barely getting touched and getting knocked out. This is why upper cuts (5's and 6's) and hooks (3's and 4's) are so often responsible for knockouts - it's harder to see them. You see a hit coming and your body involuntary tenses up the proper neck muscles to prevent brain jarring, so hitting someone at novel angels is ideal. \n\nIf your dominant hand is right your right leg should be back. Your left leg is forward. In this position punches with your left hand are jabs (1), these are the only punches you should throw consecutively. Keep jabbing pretty much nonstop. Punches with the right hand are crosses (2), these you put extra power into. You jab to set up a powerfl cross. Left Hook (3), Right Hook (4), Left Uppercut (5), Right Uppecut (6).

Many people don't know how to fall properly and if your head hits concrete... oof. My biggest nightmare\n   2. if you're on bottom, literally hug them and grip your hands together and wrap your legs around them as well. Keep them close.

If not, there's other options. \n   2. Pepper spray, small tasers on amazon for 20$, and flashlights (200+ lumens will do the trick at night, brownie points if you get a strobe one as well. Also go relatively cheap on amazon. 120ish lumens typically blinds human eyes at night)\n5. This sounds stupid but like absolute nonsense sometimes works... depending on the person. I've seen altercations avoided by someone pulling down their own pants. \n6. Avoid excessive force like using rocks as weapons (depending on if you're fighting for your life or not. If this person is trying to legit murder you, all bets off. Club em away with anything you can grab).  Avoiding that kind of stuff will help you in the possible legal repercussions that happen after. Even after a fight you didn't start, you can still get pinned with stuff. I aint a lawyer so don't fully question me on that one or how it happens...
