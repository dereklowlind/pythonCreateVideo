Graphic design. 

Every bloody person comes out of the woodwork for invitation design. Weddings, Engagement parties, Baby Showers, Birthdays... agh. 

The worst part is, friends make the worst ‘clients’ (apostrophes because I would never charge them). 

‘I love it! But can you make it a bit more...peppy?’ - WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY PEPPY, SUSAN?! Font?Colour? I don’t know what you don’t like if you can’t tell me.
God don't get me started.

Okay you did.

I love design. Absolutely. love thinking outside the box and being creative but damn. People just don't respect it and expect you to do it for "free for exposure". That also includes all the photography and illustration I do.

I will never monetize a hobby again. I am doing it for myself and my pleasure alone. Unless you are my mom, she loves my art.
Can you make photos whdn i get married? You get exposure and you will be seen and heard by others so its okay if i dont pay you right?

Like duh, if you ain't paying noone else would. Its a JOB, if you want a JOB to be done by someone else rather than you you gotta pay for it.

Seriously you dont just call a plumber or a car mechanic and tell the same story "i will tell people so more will come". Why is this a thing in creative jobs that people assume exposure is a thing they can pay with?! Who started this stupid thing?
This was my answer too. I got out of it after working as a graphic designer for 10 years because I had come to hate it so much. I still get "can you make me a flyer!?" requests.
I've been trying to get out of design forever. Any time someone asks what I do and I tell them design, the response is always, "that's sounds so cool!". My answer is always, no, it's really not. Designing for yourself, sure. Clients? Nah. Clients are 9.75/10 a giant pain in the ass.
I heard you do graphic design, can you make me a logo? An album cover? Leaflets? Flyers? Cards? Shirts?

Oh man, you took four weeks to put this all together? I thought you'd do it in like a night or something. Will $50 work? My cousin downloaded Photoshop and he doesn't charge me. Why does the color matter? I don't care about the font. 

I stepped away last year after a "major opportunity" with a "major company" tried having me design a logo without agreeing on a cost or timeframe. Now I just use ProCreate to illustrate whatever dumb nonsense I want, whenever I want.
> I don't care about the font.

Comic Sans it is.
Nah, do wingdings.
Ask them for examples. Or show them some. Takes less than five minutes on Google Images. Part of graphic design is being able to figure out what people who don't speak graphic design want when they don't even know what they want, because if they did they'd just be making shit themselves instead of asking you.
Haha yes, you are mostly right. But in my experience, paying clients find a way to choose pretty quickly, because they’re paying for changes. 

Friends want to see 5+ iterations, and still aren’t sure because they do things like this once or twice a year, not in a professional capacity.
I charge my friends, maybe with a discount, but not a big one. I think it’s better than resenting them. It also holds me accountable to giving them the best work I can and respecting them like a client.
I do some graphic design for my company (email marketing) and it pisses me off so much that I have to get it approved by someone who has no graphic design experience at all and everything he wants to change makes it 100x worse visually.

For example, I did one email campaign focusing on a product we sell having bright LEDs. At the core of it, it's literally an intercom panel that happens to have bright LED numbers. I love to be creative so I went with a Noire movie poster theme to make the entire image black and white, except for the bright green LEDs. The original ad/email looked amazing. It highlighted the colored LEDs and everything. Your eyes went straight towards where it was supposed to, making a normal, boring intercom panel into something cool and unique. As a sort of signature I usually add our company logo as a part of the image in a creative way. This time I used it as the moon in the clouds. He hated it and wondered why there was no color in it at all. He wanted our logo to be very prominent and colorful at the bottom of it and changed up the entirety of the Noir movie poster theme so there was color everywhere. I was so mad. It looked awful afterwards but alas I sent the email out.
Taping and mudding drywall.

nice. It takes practice.  Less is more is the best advice. Use the green first, and less is more. The heavy has more moisture and shrinks down, but it is strong. Keep it smooth as possible. The second and third coats are lightweight. Again, less is more. Also, run the knife over the the first coat before the next (2-3) coats to knock down any boogers. Don’t worry about inconsistencies with the lightweight because it sands down easily (if you suck at it). If you can work the knives in order to feather the outer edges you should be good.  It’s possible to finish with very minimal sanding. Sometimes a wet sponge is good enough to eliminate dust. Practice makes perfect;  I still hate it.
I hate it, but less than watching other people do it badly.
Edit: thanks for the updoots.

This is why I end up doing everything at work.

I fking hate myself for it.
Now you have twice the workload for the same pay.
That's double. Sounds great.
Im a commercial construction GC. 

When it comes to finishing drywall, I'm bad at it. I know I'm bad at it. It's the one thing I don't DIY at home. 

My reasoning- why would I spend all day doing my best only to have it look like dogshit, when I can talk to one of my finishers. Toss him some extra cash, a few beers, and let him knock it out in 2 hours. 

Money well spent.
the best way to get me to do something is to start doing it badly.
There are two things I refuse to do myself when it comes to DIY stuff; hanging doors or mudding sheetrock. A pro will knock that shit right up perfectly and look better than anything I could do.

My dad is in the exact same position at 60. I’ve picked up a lot of skills over the years but have also picked up a lot of disdain towards the job. Don’t think it’s something I will be doing until I’m 60, though I am currently trying to pull my life together and it may be my only option.
My dad too, oddly is around 60, an excellent drywall mudder / taper and painter... but not much to show for it now. He always made fairly good money too, kept his clients happy etc etc...

I personally think if he would have made an actual business out of it rather than simply offer the service, he would be better off today. If you reinvest your money and get a couple work vehicles going you can hire a crew and make sort of passive income with your knowledge.

Theres a couple other familys i know in similar situations (different trades, but similar) and doing just that seems to really make a huge difference in your success later on. 

Sort if anecdotal but my 2 cents anyways
I had my house torn down to the studs and rebuilt over a 2 year period by 3 guys who were 69, 72 & 74 at the time. Their craftsmanship is impeccable. Poor carpenter bitched every single day about there not being a single 90° angle in the house.
I’m a finish carpenter.  True square corners don’t really exist anymore because of:

- cheap fast framers

- cheap fast sheet rockers 

- mudders who mound up a ton of mud on the joints and corners.

- sheetrockers going over metal brackets.  

I still bitch about it every day.  Grumble grumble.
In like 10 percent of the time, no less.   And probably cheaper lmao
I was gathering a material list for drywalling/mudding two rooms in my home and adding bullnose corners to everything. The materials came out to like $1,200 and I figured it take me 2 or 3 weeks only working at night and on weekends. 

&#x200B;

Had a team come and do it for $1000 in like five hours and all of their work was immaculate. That shit is astounding.
That’s how I convinced my wife to hire someone to (re)finish our basement. 

We renovated one room; took about a month. Looked nice, proud of the job we did. But that room was an unused portion of the basement. The other 3/4ths were office and living space, used daily. 

I showed her how much it would cost us to DYI, how much time it would probably take and how we’d lose all that space for all that time. Had a couple people give us estimates for a little more money but it would cost none of our time and take about a third as long to complete. 

I love taking care of my own place. But when it’s basically rebuilding a whole floor, I’m happy we got a team in that knew what they were doing. 

(I *really* didn’t want to drywall three more rooms :P)
Hanging doors isn't that bad but screw mudding. Every time I do it I feel like I have everything uneven, sand it multiple times and take all day for what would be a 30 minute job for a pro.
sanding drywall
Oh man. I'm a decent builder, but not a great mudder. I built this excellent arched window in a wall with a little bar top. It turned out so nice. But I can see the mud where I didn't feather it out far enough. Just a little bump here and there instead of a smooth, flat wall. My wife and friends say they don't even see it, but man it stares right at me every time the light hits it just right. It's infuriating.
My brother. I'm a journeyman plasterer and I NEVER tell anyone that because I despise it. Especially someone who has "fixed" their own shit.
Working as a programmer. I’m good at it, it’s lucrative, but after 15 years I’m so tired of it. I just want to make enough money so I can do something else.
Learning to program in C#

I hope I don’t get burnout from one of my favorite things
I think it depends what you are making. If you are programming in a big team and have no say over anything, for me I would burn right out. But working on my own smaller projects within a business makes me feel really fulfilled, even if all I made was some minor efficiency
THIS. You nailed it man. If you force people to work a certain way or on a certain something, they'll never be motivated (unless they're into that kinda stuff but very few are).
Thing with programming is an awful lot of it is constrained once it's in a real world setting. While most places will assist you at doing work that you'd enjoy an awful lot of it is problem solving/patching that needs to be done. If everything is started from scratch nothing gets done. Your mindset is still great though just don't go to hard at it in the programming world. Source am a programmer and have several "unfinished" projects
Proper team management knows what tasks to assign to who. For instance, I work on a security product, which involves backend, frontend, automation, support, cicd, cloud infrastructure and a bunch of other categories.
I made it very clear both before and after I was hired that I'm not interested in front end but that I'll do it if it's necessary (since I'm a full stack SE). The product owner however realized that automation is where I am great at and what gets me going, so he assigns all the automation tasks in our backlog to me. Someone else was good in front end, and thus he gets the front end components etc. Imagine if he didnt give a fk and just handed random stories to everyone... We would have mediocre results and we'd be burnt out in a few months!
This. 15 years professionally now, even longer if I count the hobbyist years. Still love programming but I can't stand the majority of other developers. So many narcistic assholes.
A decade in and I honestly cannot imagine doing anything else for a career. Work sucks, but I can't think of anything else that would offer this combo of creativity, challenge, and compensation.
Same here. We make a good amount of money at this point of life, but god how I would love retiring and not having the pressure of earning a living wage.
I started programming when I was 12; I'm now pushing 50. When I did it as a hobby, and even when I did it in college, I absolutely loved every second of it. But the pointless crap that we do at the company I work for is not gratifying in the slightest - and yet, they pay me with so many wheelbarrows full of money (and fantastic benefits too) that I can't even consider quitting.

What I have done, though, is leveraged my seniority so as to do more sysadmin work and less product work. I mean, there's always some task or another that ought to be automated with a clever bash script - which means that I'm still programming, but it's a short-ish and useful thing that actually helps people I know and like, and I feel some of that old programming joy that I once felt.
What programming do you do?
I’ve done all sorts. Currently mobile focused.
Also a programmer.  I haven’t even reached a decade yet.
22 years. I have all the fundamentals, but they keep changing the frameworks, the target platforms, and the UX to the point where I've now become a jack of all trades and a master of none (unless you count outdated monolithic needs).  Retirement cannot come soon enough.
Sales.

I've been in retail for the better part of my adult life. I'm pretty decent, can get customers to where they need to be, and just overall make sure someone is happy with their purchases.

I just wish I was doing anything else. 

I just don't know what else I can go and do. I  don't have any degrees, and need money to live, so I just keep plodding along at the safe comfortable job.
Dude. Same. I can talk to and bullshit with anyone. I was selling stuff I loved, and it was fun, and I was broke. But then that progressed into a more lucrative career, and selling became more aggressive. I hated myself for feeling like I was taking advantage of the clients. But being on commission, you virtually had to if you wanted to pay your mortgage that month. I was praised for it, and told that the sky was the ceiling. I got out. I couldn't stand being so scummy, convincing people to lock themselves into shitty contracts for products that don't apply to their situation.
I was in IT sales and the money was amazing, but the stress was not worth it. Like you, I always felt I was taking advantage of my best clients. I was able to save up enough and completely switched up my career. I don't make nearly as much, but I love what I do.
I have vast retail experience, but have left it to focus on teaching English. I can only do it part time because I don't make enough to live solely on that, but at least I don't feel like I'm wasting my life filling the pockets of some higher-up who will never know that I exist.
I’m in software sales and it is soul sucking. I hate working with people, and I hate irrational buyers, but what I hate most are other sales people. The THOT Leaders on LinkedIn shit posting their motivational self-serving bullshit. The snake oil salesmen pitching their book that will change your organization. The pseudo-intellectual managers that read and digest this snake oil and think they’ve reached enlightenment through it some how. Sales is the epitome of America. First in self-confidence, 32nd in Math.
Public Speaking. I always get told how calm and collected I am, that I am clear and good at making it interesting, easy-going and interactive.

Inside I am screaming, feel like I am going to puke, panicked, absolutely sure I have a giant stain on my shirt or booger hanging out, adrenaline rushing that makes me feel like I am going to collapse the second I am off stage. I hate hate hate it!

So I get selected almost every time because, "You're so good at it, I would be a total mess up there, I don't know you do it!"

Me either Janet, me either.
That's interesting. I suck at public speaking because I feel the same way as you do inside but on the outside, I've got clammy hands, my face turns beet red, I have a hard time regulating my breathing and my voice turns shaky, and because I notice it, I then get embarrassed which then turns my voice even more shaky. It's terrible. At least you don't look like a cool when you do it.
Some forced exposure helped me: first ever speech tournament I went to, I froze up completely for a solid minute. I powered through and finished my speech tho

Every time I have to do public speaking, I go back to that experience and tell myself "I literally cannot fail harder than that, and I survived it" and that usually settles my nerves
When I had my first debate I was so damn nervous and I was sure I would be the worst, because all the others had anecdotes etc. and I couldn't come up with one. Then the debate before mine happened. The girl who was supposed to end the debate went up and she completely froze. She just walked off after a few seconds because she couldn't do it. I'm gonna be honest, I felt really bad for her, but at the same time, I felt like I couldn't do worse than that, which made me less nervous
Get beta blockers. Will change your life.
People have no idea how many people on tv, broadcasting, public speaking tours pop beta blockers.
How does one get beta blockers?  Can you literally just ask your doctor, or are they on a stricter schedule?
They aren’t strict if you genuinely have an issue. I don’t really suffer from anxiety, but when it came to presenting... I would start shaking at the smallest things (like a classic: let’s go around the room and introduce yourself) and it really messed me up for years. I shared them the symptoms and was prescribed easily and it has been a life saver.
Nah I literally told my doc I have trouble with public speaking and she gave me a script for propanalol. Works like a charm.
I’m in the same boat... I think people like us are good at it because we do worry about the finer details like a stain on our shirt rather than “being a total mess up there”.
Same.  I'm a member of Alcoholics Anonymous and was asked to speak SIXTEEN TIMES in a single year.  In multiple cities.  I want to throw up every single time.
When I was 18 I was petrified of speaking to people I didn't know.  My first job was retail, and after a week the boss left for a week long business trip.  Trail by fire.  I HAD to talk to people.  Turned out it wasn't as horrible as I thought it would be.  My confidence really grew, knowing people wouldn't back away in disgust if I started talking to them.  Later on I joined a church where speaking to large groups (teaching and meetings) was kind of a must, and I just got used to it.  University group projects (barf) saw me ALWAYS being the mouthpiece of the group for 2 reasons:  first, no one else wanted to, and secondly, the thought of those dweebs messing up my hard work with their inability to read out loud or even make our topic the least bit engaging made me twitchy.  I know a lot of people fear public speaking more than death, but for me, after many many years of just doing it, I don't even sweat it.  I have emceed various large functions and spoken (and sang) in front of about 1000 people and no one has voice their hatred for me yet!   I guess I should also point out that I have never been paid to speak/sing/emcee.  I think if I were getting paid I would be a little more stressed about trying to be perfect.
Backstroke. I’m apparently fast at it, but it’s still "nasal destruction"
I just hate how blind you are, watching the ceiling scroll by, hoping to catch a glimpse of the flags soon. My high school had 25 yard pools. That was bearable, but the 50 meter pools are like you’re lost in the abyss.
Outdoor 50m pools are the worse. Especially if it’s sunny out and clear as day you have nothing to go off of so you’re normally zigzagging all over the place and hitting the lane line
I disagree. I got to the point where I refused to train backstroke unless I was outside. It was the neverending lines on the celing that wrecked my sanity, I literally started hearing calliope music in my head during endurance backstroke sets.
> calliope music

TIL what calliope music is
I get distracted by birds... then panic they will shit on me
I had swim classes as a kid and while doing backstroke in one of those outdoor pools, I ended up cracking my head on the side at full speed. Everyone was watching.
Ugh. I was out doing a sprint backstroke set during practice at an outdoor 50m over the summer a couple of years ago. Sun was in my eyes and all. Through my squinting I ended up passing the flags without realizing it and getting a concussion from hitting the wall so hard. Haven’t quite mentally recovered from it and I’m still nervous and doing backstroke to this day because of it. Fuck backstroke and outdoor 50m pools
The feeling of "the abyss" is very meditative if you're not competing, but I agree I hated backstroke when I was on swim team
Hah! Not an expected reply, also, doesn’t backstroke not inundate your nose with water? I’m picturing a cartoonishly fast, yet awesome backstroke, simply to avoid “nose water”
It is one of those strokes where at least competitively you go faster underwater on your turns/off the wall than you actually do with the stroke.  Thus nasal destruction - nothing worse then being underwater and upside down.
Swam backstroke event and medley relay on swim team. No, water doesn’t get in your nose, never really thought about why. I’m surprised as a swimmer they didn’t say butterfly. That’s the stroke we all loved to hate.
i havent been on a swim team in years and the word "butterfly" still makes my muscles hurt
I always thought the same thing about butterfly. I was fast at it, but it was just draining and I hated every second of it
I feel your pain, unfortunately my best event was 200m butterfly. So many practices ended with me hardly being able to lift my arms.
Customer support. Fuck me.
Same. My coworkers have always told me I have the best customer service but I absolutely despise it and get anxiety just knowing I have to speak to these people.
This is me. I'm good with people because I've honed a polite style of communication out of contempt for talking with people.
This! I always get told I am the best and should move up in my company but I don't want to. I don't want the extra responsibility and I don't want the extra work. I just want to do my job get my check and go home and forget that work exists.
> Fuck me.

so you are a prostitute?
probably would fk
Yeah
Mediating between people who can’t get along. It is so fking annoying and I haaaate it,  turns I get stuck doing it all the time at work. Ugh, just thinking about it is stressing me out.
It’s nice to know I’m not the only one. Recently informed a bunch of people I’m going to start billing them.
I just went to my company and said, 'Get me the hell out of here please.'.
Ugh. Me too. This is one of best skills. (Used more with my sisters than at work, but comes handy there as well.) I hate it though. It’s emotionally draining and why can’t adults figure their shit out without needing a third party? I find myself either mediating and taking on the stress of the  situation or removing myself altogether and shutting myself off from everyone. Happy mediums are the hardest thing to find I think.
Would being paid shitload of money make you feel better? Because I know a few companies that have offices full of bickering mid-level micromanagers who could use some mediation.
Can confirm.  I spent the last 2 years doing exactly this: mediating slapfights among the office team to try to get the work done as a Group Director.  That's pretty much *all* I did, and I was paid *extremely* well (well into six figures) because I was pretty successful at it.

I was ostensibly hired for my expertise in another area, but it really came down to glorified office counselor.  And they were happy with that, because they needed it, and they paid me for it.  And the perks were insane.

The job definitely exists.

EDIT:  For those reading this that are like, "I could do that, how do I get into that", the truth is you really don't.  There's no such thing as a "Professional Office Mediator" position that you can find on LinkedIn and apply for off the street.  ([See for yourself.] 

/u/Paligor correctly stated elsewhere that you basically have to start in Program Management.  Then you move up to a GM or Director position, then Group Director, then VP.  Each successive role manages each other one down the chain.  Long story short, the kind of job I describe above is not one you find, it's one you find yourself *in*.
I am listening...
Professional mediators charge as much as $10,000/day of mediation & the certification to become one is a 40 hour class. They may have recently changed the law though; you might have to be an attorney now. I'm not 100% sure.

Edit: It's not as easy as taking the class and making that kind of cash. For example, I'm a certified mediator and have certs in advanced family, domestic violence, and CPS mediation training as well as arbitration training. Yet I've never made any money from it - for me it's just something for the resume. Additionally, people don't typically hire you to be a counselor with the end goal that the two people will get along after the mediation. It's usually to get some sort of deal moving that has come to a standstill because both parties refuse to negotiate, for example splitting up assets in a divorce. For that reason there's a lot of legal procedures that you can't really learn in a 40 hour class but you will certainly need to know if you're considering being a full time mediator. Just felt like I needed to elaborate on that a bit.
In most states (I haven't checked all of them) you do not have to be an attorney.  I'm an attorney, and it's surprisingly easy to become a court certified mediator.

Edit:  Top level mediators may make that much in a day, but I would imagine it's pretty rare.  Entry level mediators make far less, and are often volunteers.  If I were to conduct a mediation between two parties I would probably charge around $150-$200/hr.
ok, that sounds like marketing lingo (As Much as!!! 100Mbps!!^actually_avg_5Mbps ). Whats the avg $/day?
One free Coke from the cafeteria vending machine, and parking validation.

Then turn them down. You have to have standards or no one will respect you.

If you're good at it but don't do it, then people will say you're bad at it.

Edit: OP said Cleaning.
Because anyone can be good at cleaning (at least a home, anyway). It's the doing that makes you good or bad at it.  They say they hate it, so they probably have some serious willpower
For me it's the attention to detail, sure I could clean, but while most people would clean 80% of the way and leave lots of finer details untouched, I see those details and want to clean it all, and that just takes forever. You can do 80% of the work in 20% of the time, but that final 20% to properly clean takes 4x as long
Counterargument: I am better at cleaning than you. I finish it in 1/5 the time you do for 80% of the cleanliness. Because in the end, I just have to clean enough that most people would be happy with it (myself included). Perfection is the enemy of good and all that.  You may be more thorough, but I can move on to recreation or yardwork or taking my kids to fun things or learn a new skill (but lets be honest, I'm on reddit. Look, I'm saying COULD not WOULD). You're still cleaning. That last 20% can be done once a week, or even once a month depending on what it is.
Does that include removing dust from furnitures (desktop, tables etc), electronics and the likes? 

Infact, 

> That last 20% can be done once a week, or even once a month depending on what it is.

Got me curious - how do u clean and how often?
Careful boys, we have ourselves a clean-off
Yup. I'm a retentive bastard, so if I'm gonna clean something, it's fkin' *clean*.
Watching my wife wash her car < water boarding
I had two pulmonary embolism a few years back and was in bad shape but chose to be home instead of hospital because who the hell was gonna watch the kids? My husband decided to clean the kitchen floors before he left for the grocery store. I watched him work from the couch and it was torture. When he got home he looked at the floor and then at my half dead ass on the couch and said, "you got up and cleaned it again didn't you?". Maybe.
My mom is like this. She'll never be satisfied unless it's her doing it.
If you're wired to notice everything and you've developed an efficient and thorough way to clean, it's very hard to give it up to others. Honestly this is what I think causes a lot of issues for people. They don't realize they steamroll anyone who tries to help because they're just trying to get it done right in their mind. Then one day years later they're complaining that no one helps around the house. Because everyone's been rather trained not to. It was hard for me to ease up and get everyone else to help. It didn't help that my husband at the time was truly unwilling to help most the time. But I could see I needed to change and I've gotten better.
>If you're wired to notice everything and you've developed an efficient and thorough way to clean, it's very hard to give it up to others.

Did I mention that I was deaf and most of my input comes visually? 🤣
Same
Firing people.  I’ve had to terminate people in multiple jobs (usually when I’m the new person brought in to turn things around). 

The last time I had to tell someone, the HR VP who was in the room as well told me “wow you are really good at this. We should have you do a video training on how to let people go”.   

Btw if you have to fire someone (aside from a really bad reason like theft etc), get them a severance, don’t fight their unemployment claim, and cover their healthcare for a few months. Not every person works out for a job and these things make landing in their feet much easier
Someone who hates having to fire people sounds like the perfect person to be put in charge of it.
Sounds like a trilogy of novels called Scythe, society has eliminated all disease and humans can live on forever, but now there are people appointed as “Scythes”  who serve as the tool to administer death as to regulate population growth. Long story short, you pick the people who hate doing it, as they are the most compassionate about how it’s done.
Thanks for the recommendation. I just read the first chapter of the first book and ordered all 3.
I’m so happy to hear that! I wasn’t going to comment but I thought to myself “but what if I’m the reason someone decides to read these books and it ends up being their favourite, I have to make the comment just in case” the first two books are my favourite but I’m not finished the third yet, I hope you enjoy them!
That's a neat idea
You should hire him!
But i have to fire someone to hire him and I dont know how.
The interview process will just be them firing their predecessor.
I got laid off from my last job. Bad situation, bad management, but I was given a decent severance. Despite my best efforts, I didn't line a job up before my severance ended, so I signed up for unemployment. That company then had the gall to tell the unemployment office I'd been fired. I was floored. The company couldn't prove there was reason to fire me, though, so I got the unemployment.

I don't understand how people think that's no big deal. If someone in the company lied to a government office to save some $$, what else are they lying about?

Respect goes a long, long ways. I think most people understand that layoffs and letting people go are necessary things, but it should be done in a thoughtful and respectful way. Kudos to you for showing respect the people you had to let go.
Are you George Clooney?
Sadly I have far less hair than he does. (And compensated much less)
Well at least you didn't get fked over by Vera Farmiga. ....then again.
And at least you’re not selling your soul to fking Nestle.
I'll still watch a movie with you in it, and tell my wife to quit calling you dreamy
Up in the Air?
I was laid off two months ago and I was told and hour before I left for the day. I was also told that it would be my last day of coverage and if I wanted to continue my coverage it would be $852 a month out of my pocket. I immediately applied for unemployment benefits and my employer fought it saying that I quit. Former coworkers told me that my manager had known for a week before she told me and that she said that I wasn't going to be offered a severance package because they had "done enough for me." What did they do for me aside from belittling me for little pay? I have no idea. My manager still tries to message me by saying she misses me. 
I'm broke, but I am so happy to be out of that place.
And please give them their COBRA notices
Lying
[deleted]
I understand that perfectly. It almost becomes second nature. 

I've found making a sincere effort to tell the truth, regardless of consequences is key to moving past this habit. Its gotta be a promise to yourself; and if theres one gift you can give yourself, it's being honest with yourself. 

And you will still slip up, but with some grit you can correct yourself after. Friends and family will understand that you're trying to improve and respect you more after some time.
One thing I've found in my journey to being an honest person is that all the times I wanted to lie to avoid something scary, but forced myself to tell the truth: the fallout wasn't that bad. Life went on, ya know?

I still find myself lying about little embarrassing things that happen to me, like when I broke my glasses and sliced up my face trying to hang upside down from a door but said I banged my head on a cabinet.
I used to have a problem with lying about lame things, now if I catch myself in a lie I just correct myself "Hey bro, where were you Friday?" "Oh yeah man, kid was sick... Wait that was a lie, I took a personal day." It can be a little awkward, but I find it's better than having to remember my immature lies.
Oof, I do that too. I'll automatically lie about stuff that doesn't matter at all, just because I'm used to doing it (defense mechanism leftover from childhood).  Instead of rolling with it, I IMMEDIATELY say, "I'm sorry, that was a lie. Actually..."  


My close friends are used to it and don't give me a hard time about it.
Yeah, I threw out a few half obvious lies and then got serious when I was actually trying to pull it off.
When I used to play poker with my family at like age 9 or 10, I would give very obvious tells assuming they thought I was too young to control my reaction.
I've found that people who lie constantly aren't actually that believable, it's that it's a lot of effort to call them out and get in an argument about something so inconsequential. So you just go "yeah sure, right." to everything they say while secretly rolling your eyes. Then the person doing the lying is like "wow look at this dumbass, totally pulled one over on them!" Not really, man.
EXACTLY! Most of the time people who are so convinced they’re amazing liars just aren’t being called out for it and everyone else is just acting along with it. It’s the worst when people brag about how good they are and use an example that you caught on to when it happened
I'm thinking it's more of a boy who cried wolf situation. Like, you've caught their lies a few times, and now you assume they're lying a lot even when they're not.

What gets me is when people say they're good at manipulating people, and I'm like, "no you're not, you just turn into a passive aggressive bitch sometimes."
You’re probably not as good at lying as you think. In my experience with friends who lie constantly, everyone in the room knows that they’re lying but never fights them on it. People would just rather share a quick glance with someone else with the “oh, here we go again” look, and not get into a dumb argument
Do you know you’re good at it? If so, how? I’d think that when it comes to lying, that hating it would also make you bad at it?
I think you can get a feel if you are being convincing or not.

Also, it is a good thought experiment if you have quick-thinking and doesn't put any holes in your story. Making it simple.

(Or even, try to come up with a more believable and elaborated story, but with more time to prepare, I like as a thought experiment, but not the idea of doing. You are also examing what you can really know as a fact and what was just told you)

And rely on the fact that many times when it is not a big deal people just won't really care.

Guess is something you can naturally do but has some moral questions afterwards that bugs you. It happens to me sometimes, if lying was really the right choice to do.

I wouldn't say I do this often or I'm really good, but sometimes I do.
You’re reply is much more realistic and coherent than the one I just replied to. I’m adept at changing subjects, and I know people don’t care. But authenticity matters, and I do try and make my values match my actions. I fail sometimes. We all do, there is no shame in shamefully missing the mark.
With some age I realized that I have internalized a rather complicated mechanism of being good at lying. About 60-70% of what I say is the truth. 30-20% are simple white lies. This is what makes people think me as a funny guy who says stupid things to have a bit of laugh. 

The rest 10% is where I actually lie. These are lies that will alter my life if it every comes out. Everyone believes them obviously, even me.
> The rest 10% is where I actually lie. These are lies that will alter my life if it every comes out.

These are the ones.  All these people saying, "everybody can tell you're lying it's just not worth the effort to call you out," aren't getting this point.  These are the lies that people would *absolutely* have to call you out on, the lies that actually matter.  In order for this to work, you need that initial ~90% to be out in the open.  They need to know you're *certainly* telling the truth the majority of the time, and they must know that you both know when you're not on that other 20-30%.

Those other ones are your lies "worth" telling, because you get something out of it.  You're not supposed to have whatever that is, so it has to stay buried.  You're playing the risk/reward game.  If nobody knows, you're winning.

> Everyone believes them obviously, even me.

This is kind of a misnomer in my opinion, because you know.  You just cover it up mentally with the outward truth, what everybody must know to be the truth.  You're not actually convinced, you're just conditioned.
Oh you are absolutely right. This whole mechanism has become like muscle memory for me. I don't even need to cover it up, it just becomes the truth in my mind. I think its just a result of the years of "fake it till you make it" attitude that I have conditioned myself from childhood.
This hit me on a personal level.
Customer Service. 
I'm a great listener, really good with empathy vs sympathy and all that, but I hate people. Not all people, you get the good ones sometimes. But I generally hate dealing with customers. My resume is full of it though and it becomes hard to ever get out of it. I'd rather work alone.

Edit: wow i did not think this comment would have such a response! Thanks for the awards! Glad I'm not the only one struggling to escape customer service ❤
Felt this in my soul. Currently wearing a headset and multitasking in 3 different ways, listening to dial tone after dial tone.
Saaaame. I finally got promoted out of it and I'm scared I'll be demoted back to it because I'm so good at it and much better than everyone else at my company. I work "alone" now and it's wonderful and I hold onto my job like Smeagol with the ring.
I totally get that. I haven't been promoted where I am right now but that scares me too. 
If you don't mind my asking, what do you do now? I dream of feeling like that about a job too haha
No chance of promotion at the retail place I work at, and it's already incredibly disproportionate how many managers they have and how few workers, I just want to get out of this horrible line of work. I'm a good peoples person, but it is incredibly draining and the shitty people outweigh the good, and I hold a grudge. I can't stand how people think it's okay to treat others like garbage just because they can. Nothing bothers me more than that in life.
Yeah dude I feel that, I worked in customer service for some years.  what helped me was imagining how shitty and sad these peoples lives must be in order to make them act so poorly to strangers, and recognizing that by living a good life and surrounding myself with genuine people who care about me, I’ll still have a better life than them. It’s a bit petty, viewing yourself as superior in that regard, but it really worked for me.
I use that same coping mechanism where I evaluate my life vs theirs but I never found it petty.  I almost always found it sad and depressing that these people cannot wrap their head  around how unpleasant they are and how much it has to be negatively effecting their lives.

Edit.  Changed pretty to petty to more easily reflect what I was replying.  Darn autocorrect.
Become a trainer. Train folks to do what you do and they can't put you back!! Got me out of it 😂
I left a job where I was (by my managers own admission) not considered for a promotion because I was "too great" with customers. It all worked out for the best since at my new job I work alone 90% of the time (and am also Smeagoling).
I've done various customer service type jobs over the past 15 or so years, and I recently got a job where I never get phone calls, I work alone, and no one needs anything from me half the time, and if they do, it's done via e-mail. I must do everything I can to keep this position.

But I'm the same as OP. I think I'm extremely good at customer service and have been recognized for it in other jobs. I would sometimes get gifts and tons of praise from the "regulars" and it was a good feeling. I even judge others when I see poor customer service and try to tip well or acknowledge when I see someone going above and beyond. 

Oh and for the record, can we all agree that if you're dealing with customers.. DO NOT CHEW GUM!!!
I’m currently working in Compliance for a big HR company. It’s so fking awesome. My boss works on the other side of the country, everyone I work with is super chill, I listen to podcasts/music all day in an unsupervised, quiet office (cubicle). I’m so happy with my work now. I don’t have to talk to clients or even my coworkers really. Just computer/analysis work all day. 

I brag to give a recommendation. As someone who previously worked retail/customer service jobs for over a decade: what got me this job was my experience working in a bank/credit union. They hired me because of my KYC (know your client) knowledge. If you want to move out of the customer service arena, get a job at a bank and then look to move out after that. Best of luck!
Can confirm. Worked fastfood then became a teller worked my way up and 3 years later I'm a full time banker and now I'm interviewing for back office jobs (wish me luck please!). I make pretty damn good money and get good benefits all with just an associate's degree. Starting a bank job was the best decision I could've made despite it being pretty shitty some days, it's always better than managing a fast food place. I still haven't forgotten what that's like and will forever be grateful for my job now.



Edit- Thank you to everyone wishing me good luck. It's much appreciated
Same here! I worked at a movie theater and then got a job as a teller. Worked a few branch positions before moving to a back office role. Found a direction I liked and made a change or two and now I’ve found myself a nice career with more growth on the horizon. I was considered for my first back office role largely because of my compliance experience, my last branch role had a big compliance element to it, and then I forged my own path from there. 

Combination of hard work and good timing to get to where I am today but I’m so happy I applied for that teller role.
Same here.   I worked for years in various roles at a Walgreens and did retail pharmacy there.   Then I got a job as a teller at a credit union, which is an option for those that don’t want to be forced into selling stuff.   I quickly got a job in the back office.   I’m still in customer service but eventually I can apply of other positions.   I still haven’t been here long.    Most in this company have been here for years.   Like 15 to 25 years and the pay is better even for a part time teller. No one make minimum wage.   If you are stuck in a low paying customer service job apply to be a teller because they frequently pay better and the room for advancement is there unlike at most customer service jobs!
Would you recommend applying for a position as a teller?  Seems like the kind of job that'll be cut thanks to the drop in street banking
Yes, if you're good at your job you'll move up very quickly and if you're not well at least you'll learn that quickly. Being a teller is not a career it's a starting point. It's not like you're trying to become a trucker and all the jobs will be gone soon because of autonomous vehicles. Being a teller has transferrable skills
I've never felt more understood than reading this comment.
My favorite part of customer service is seeing the people who get excited and happy about the product they are getting.   


My second favorite part is discovering new ways to be passive aggressive to the elderly people who are rude as fk.
I was in the same boat. Having "customer service" in your title kills your chances of doing anything else. Every company I worked at CS is a black hole and other depts dont want anything to do with you or think your only skill is resetting a password. 

It is soul sucking work and I hope you find something different soon.
I just resigned today on the spot from my customer service job, no idea what i’m gonna do but I feel so free right now.
Ugh i hated working callcentres. Annoyingly I have a lovely phone manner and I'm great at settling confrontations and helping people out so i just fell into it for 7 years or so. But I loathed it with a passion. 
It gave me some pretty good life skills though in reading people and directing conversations, listening for intent behind what's being said and so on.
It's strange how sometimes the things that make you suffer the most end up being the most beneficial.

I always say customer service made me the person I am today; though I'll never, ever go back.
Customer service is mentally debilitating. Anyone in customer service needs unfettered access to mental healthcare. I've gone weeks messed up before by the way I was treated and talked to and I cant stand up for myself because all they have to do is write a complaint to corporate.
Fixing computers. Sad part is I do this for a living. I love everything about computers, networking, etc. But when I get a phone call from an inept user who makes triple my salary, or an older relative calls for “computer help”, the eye rolls ensue and the thoughts of hanging up kick in.
I'm in IT as well. I hate printers
What happened. Where did we go wrong with printers. 

Who fked up? Who's head should we be wringing? 

Why are printers so fking shit. Why do they not just work. Why is there always a fking song and a rain dance to get these things to do what they should.
I feel like it's because you practically have to be a mechanic to fix them. It's one of the few PC related things left that still have so many moving, mechanical parts.
I would agree but also disagree. My first job was a printer technician and I was 19. While, yes, they are complicated mechanically, they're realistically not all too difficult to fix. Just a TON of screws, dear lord...
I was in PC support up until last August and the problem with us was they didn't give us the tools or training to fix them. That was Break/Fix's job. But we still had to go look at every printer we got a ticket for and make sure it wasn't just the user being dumb and if it was a jam, make sure we couldn't unjam it ourselves but I barely knew what I was looking at when I'd open one of them up because no one ever taught me and it's not like I had time to sit in front of one and research it myself.

Edit: We also weren't allowed to unscrew anything because we weren't certified to do so. Break/Fix were the only ones who were allowed.
>Edit: We also weren't allowed to unscrew anything because we weren't certified to do so. Break/Fix were the only ones who were allowed.
  
This is probably what held you up most. So many fixes just involved removing a panel or two and removing some stuck torn paper, swapping out a roller, a solenoid, or even something as simple as the fuser. Very rarely did we have to go deep and get dirty swapping a main board.
The biggest problem by far is the software.  You can get printers that are pretty reliable as far as hardware goes.  Where I work we have some HP printers that have been really solid despite being in a shitty industrial environment (concrete dust and even metal dust gets everywhere, plus high humidity) for several years.

But most printers have absolutely garbage firmware and drivers.  It's like somebody wrote that shit in machine code 40 years ago, didn't document it, and nobody has touched it since.  Printers are notorious for using horrendously outdated protocols and being about as secure as your average waist high fence.  A whole bunch of them *still* use SMB 1.  A whole bunch of them are gonna have more problems when MS switches off legacy LDAP connections here in a couple months.

If you're in a business environment, you're a fool to not just have a lease contract for your printers.  It's totally worth it to just be able to call a number and say "come replace/fix this piece of shit", and let somebody else deal with it.
No printer I have owned has ever stopped working mechanically. It's always been some issue with the software or connectivity issues with devices in the house. It's always gotten to the point where I have to download drivers again and restart it 15 times just to get it to connect to the device I want then it has a panic attack about a software update that updates jack shit and it's about that time I usually start looking at a new printer online. I hate printers
I decided to buy a Sabre printer and it has been great!
I've been in IT for 18 years, far removed from help desk work, and I still fking hate printers. All except the humble Brother laser I have at home, which has been the sole exception in all this time.
Not in IT, but can build computers and have extensive knowledge....i dont touch printers. The bane of technology.
Indeed. I even use the built-in Acrobat signature fonts to sign PDFs instead of printing them for wet signature. I'll also print to PDF from other formats just to do this if I have to.
Haven't you learned by now? You should never have brought your Brother laser into this. Its guaranteed to shit the bed any day now.
Fuck yeah, Brother lazer printers ftw. I’ve heard stories of software updates not allowing people to use 3rd party carts. So glad I lucked out with this brand
Printers are fking dumb.
Printers hate everyone.

I'm sure my printer is listening and will punish me later for saying this.
Same - Even worse is neighbors and family members. 

When I get home from a day of work, plomp myself on the couch to watch some Netflix and there is my old neighbor at the door. Asking me to help him.

I'll do it, because he is old but still. Grrrrrr.
The worst part is that they expect you to know every single electronic device and software ever created. 

"What you do you mean you don't know how my 20 year old accounting software works? I thought you studied computer science!!"
Dude my brother started running his own business and he expected me to teach him how to use the accounting software. I have literally zero idea how this works, just because I program does not mean I know how every piece of software works.
Similarly, I'm a sysadmin for an engineering/architecture firm. Helpdesk is responsible for installing Autodesk products, I maintain the licensing server and packages for deployment of said software, but I'll be goddamned if I could tell you why x thing in Revit isn't working.
It's tough to be 70 years old and faced with with a computer problem.

 To people born before the digital age, a computer is a completely opaque machine with a keyboard.

"What is google anyway? Where is it? How do I find it? Where and what is a "link" and where is the "click"?
My rent agreement with my landlord includes tech support for her. She's 72 and terrible with technology, but she's a good listener and takes notes. Seeing her notes makes my day. 

"Triple click on the words to blue them." Instead of highlighting she calls it that.
'A virus must have downloaded all this porn.'
There's nothing wrong with triple salary as such.

It when it is "I'm the (insert acronym) and I demand it be fixed, that you drop everything, NOW!"
At my company there are at least 80 people with the title of VP. Honestly we don’t “rush” anything anymore unless our CEO or President request something or if there’s massive system failure. People try to title toss all the time but to us everyone is a user lol.
What I used to like doing is print to someone's printer.

The system used a Citrix virtualised desktop and the senior line managers offices were visible as locations. I couldn't log into their desktop but I could add their printer as a print destination.

"Oh, I didn't get the email!"

"Hang on" prints to appropriate printer. "It should be sitting on your printer."

"The what now?"

Edit. Thanks for silver!
See if I had this type of setup I would get fired. I would print memes to random offices constantly. At least until they decide to fire me 4 hours in to my first day.
Just tell them the problem lies within their version of google ultron
My wife served on a nonprofit board. One of the older members tried to insist he didn't review a document before a meeting because he had the wrong version of google docs.
Hahahahahahaha that gave me a real chuckle thank you lol

Writing. I was told by a fairly strict English professor that I should become an English professor because of my essays and I didn't have the heart to tell him that I just sincerely despise writing.
This is the main reason I stopped writing. You can tell me how good I am over and over and over but when the act of writing is akin to ramming your head into a wall repeatedly until the words fall out I think I'd rather find something else to do.
I'm happy I'm not alone in my hatred of writing, especially since you captured my exact feelings that perfectly
Finishing my thesis right now. I've hated writing since elementary school. Back then I was bad at it and I hated it. Nowadays I'm praised for the quality of my work, but I still hate it. Every paragraph takes so much willpower, its like running a marathon! I just have to keep telling myself "one more paragraph" ad nauseam .
That's how I was during undergrad. Deadlines and the pressure to always write perfectly really fked up my ability to write. Every writing assignment seemed like a huge challenge because I kept trying to uphold my status as top student in the department. I got told to stay for a PhD, but I noped the fk out of there because I couldn't stand the thought of writing for 5-6 more years.
I will say that even for people who like writing it's not always easy or fun. I love writing and am close to finishing a novel (well, the first draft), and though there have been some profoundly wonderful feelings that emerged, there's a heaviness in each sentence that takes energy lift. It can wipe anyone out. But maintaining that exertion with proper input from elsewhere is necessary, kind of like how an exhale requires an inhale. And it isn't always going to be cathartic. Being a writer, as far as I can tell, doesn't imply that the process of writing comes easy to you, but rather that you know how to keep yourself moving forward even when (not if) it gets difficult.

Of course, the process and stress to get that exhalation has to feel worth it to you,or else yes, I agree, you ought to find something else to do with your time.
Sounds like something a really good writer would do.  He should try being a writing professor.
Moreover, my therapist suggested I write as a form of stress relief. I told her that she didn't realize how much effort it takes and how strictly eloquent writing was beat into me in elementary school. "Casual writing" is not realistic for me.
I’m no therapist but maybe record yourself talking what you otherwise would be writing about. Takes the effort out of it and allows it to be really casual.
Or even try to break out of that "eloquent" writing habit. I know it can be deeply ingrained in a person's head but they can practice "free flow" writing where they are literally just typing out the first thing that comes into their head without going back and editing everything 500 times. It can be just as invigorating as writing everything with perfect grammar.
I like the way you wrote that, very eloquent indeed. You should consider finding a job in writing!
as someone who likes writing this is so confusing to me.

I'm in science so writing is an absolutely solid chunk of what we do, but for some reason I have never had a problem with just sitting down and pouring words onto a page.

But then, I guess I always figured "it doesn't need to be good, it just needs to be clear".
God I'm glad I'm not alone. You captured my feelings perfectly. I always crank out a paper the night before, hate every goddamn moment of writing it, and always get an A or a B. Fuck this gift, I wish I could re gift it to someone who actually enjoys writing.
This is me. I have been told by multiple teachers that I am an excellent writer, and yes, I am proud of my work once it's done, but it takes so much out of me to really create something good. I am incapable of half-assing a paper: I fawn over every word, and cannot leave anything be until it is perfect. The end result probably looks like it just flowed out of me, but it didn't. I probably spent all night on the first paragraph alone.

So, yes, I am good at it, but that does not mean that I could make a career out of it while maintaining my sanity. I program computers now. Much cleaner, logical, and to the point, although I do still occasionally catch myself worrying more about elegant form than function to a detrimental degree, but it is far less of an issue than with writing in English.
I relate to this way too much. I've spent hour-long periods just trying to think of how to convey sentences and it's hell
Same with me. I was praised for my writing from middle school through college, from topical essays to poems to basic research papers. By no means did I ever *enjoy* writing anything, though. Writing is the act of learning to hate yourself, one word at a time.
Yeah, not a lot of happy ever after stories w/ writers.  Mostly just depression, substance abuse and suicide.  Except Judy Blume... I hear she’s doing well.
I took a non fiction writing course from Dennis Covington in college.  When I turned in my first paper he called me up and said “I have nothing to teach you.”  Most amazing compliment of my entire life, as he is an amazing author.  He tried many times to get me to change my major and offered me an internship that is so incredible I won’t even mention where... because my dumbass turned it down.  Why?  To get married.  Oof.  
19 year old me was a brilliant moron.
I would die to have anyone tell me I was that good at anything.
I think you're better at desiring validation than anyone I've ever met
Are you one of those asshole genies in a bottle that gives you exactly what you asked for but not exactly what you wanted because you didn't phrase the wish carefully enough?
I'm just a guy tryna validate strangers on the internet.

I think you're handsome
Yeah no matter how intelligent they are, all 19 year-olds are morons
Can confirm.
Source: am 19
I remember when I turned 20, and it wasn't an immediate thing, more just as I got into being 20, at some point I felt the teenage hormones finally subside and I realized a few things. For one I felt very fragile physically. Like I don't know what it was, but 18-19 year old me get invincible, indestructible. 20 year old me was very aware of my own mortality. I felt like I thought more clearly in my 20's as well. Like so much less brain fog than my teenage years. Which I mean the brain is still developing until you reach your 20's, so that makes some sense. Not to say people in their 20's are super brilliant either, but then again people in every agree category have their dumb side, I guess it just shows some people never mature to functioning adult status. 

But yeah, 18-19 you're still a teenager, in mind as well as body.
If you don't hate writing, what's keeping you from getting back in the game? You might even contact Dennis Covington again. If he tried so hard he will probably remember you.
I’ve considered it.  Especially now that I have some real life experience.  It was such a huge honor to have an opportunity to learn from him. Despite saying he had nothing to teach me, he vastly underestimated his ability to impact young writers.
You're really only shooting yourself more in the foot if you don't.  The older I get the more I realize people for the most part love helping other people in their own fields.  Also, the older I get the more I realize the only thing holding me back a lot of times were my own preconceived notions of how others would react.
Oh man. This hit me in the soul. I wanted to be a chef at 18, and had the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to eat at El Bulli, in Spain, which was widely considered to be the best restaurant in the world at the time (2004). The table next to us were members of the Spanish government, and after the meal, the chef, Feran Adria, came and smoked cigars and chatted with them. We'd been silly and chatty with them through the meal, so afterwards we were all talking, and it was lovely. The night was ending and we went out to get in our cab, and I suddenly got this bolt of bravery/wine courage and walked back inside, right up to Feran Adria and told him I wanted a job. He kissed my cheek and gave me his personal email address and invited me back, told me I could stay with his family and intern. When I went back to the states and told my boyfriend, he was like... "but what would I do?" So I never emailed the chef, and never went back. I've told that story in pro kitchens a few times and literally been slapped for my idiocy. I still can't believe that I squandered that opportunity.
My mother was a English Professor at a fairly prestigious University. So even though I also despise writing papers, I got damn good at cranking out A+ essays like clock work.
> got damn good at cranking out A+ essays like clock work.

please write my term paper for me ^(/s)

No, lol
Thomas Mann — ‘A writer is someone for whom writing is more difficult than it is for other people.'
This is me. I wrote poetry and was marked as next one to watch by the top poet in my country. I havent written anything in 10 years. Someone saw a poem I wrote in 10th grade and made a song with a mainstream singer. But I hate writing and am in a totally different profession now.
The fact that you received that much recognition is awesome, but I totally understand the hatred of writing poetry
Talking to people.
26 years in retail. I could win an Oscar for the amount of believable lies I tell customers.

You are the face of the company. You're always supposed to be smiling, happy, and able to carry on a single serving conversation with anyone you meet.

Off the clock, and when I was single, I was very content going days without any talking or interaction.

I kinda learned to be two different people, sometimes more depending on my life at the time.

I'm tired of acting.
I work at a pet store and the idea that I send animals home to people who just want a pet for their kid to neglect is terrible.   Even after I tell them no to the animal the parents get mad bc I refuse to make a small child happy.   Fuck you man.. you're 3 year old isnt gonna be cleaning  this you would and so far you haven't convinced me o youll do that.     But I cant tell people to fk off.    So I stick to the polite statement of do more research bc it sounds like you're unsure if you're committed to this long term relationship.
It's funny there is a corporate pet store (large chain, not a mom and pop) near me that is crazy Hardline. They don't sell fish or small animals to people who don't take a 1 hour class on that animal/freshwater or saltwater tank. I thought that was cool. Also the groomers are hella legit. I was chatting one of the groomers and she said their location, despite the rules, is one of the highest earners in the area so corporate lets them keep them. I guess they also are a "testing store" for new products, so I usually get free samples of dog treats basically in bulk.
Incredible. I wish I had been able to do that, or even deny sales. I worked in one of the big corporate stores and was written up for denying the sale of all 12 of our baby Oscars to a guy who told me he was putting them all in a 10 gallon he just set up an hour ago because "they're so small, what do they need a big empty tank for?!". Brutal, and worse, when those customers come back with their dead fish and we have to replace them per our guarantee, knowing full well they died because this guy is an idiot, and the next round is gonna die too. That job was crushing.
I work for big corporate store X, not a pet store, but we used to sell fish. It was absolutely terrible. I worked in a completely unrelated department next door to pets, and would constantly get roped into getting them for people because I wasn't afraid to use the net to get the fish.

&#x200B;

Of course every time I went to get them little Timmy wanted *that specific* goldfish, not any of the others. I think we had one person that worked pets at all. Every time you opened the tanks it smelled like death, and cleaning out the dead ones was a daily chore. You were supposed to mark down what kind of fish it was that died, but I'm no good at identifying skeletons after the others have eaten it.

&#x200B;

Keep in mind too I have no fking clue anything about fish. Never owned one in my life. And of course I'm expected to be the fish whisperer for a couple bucks over minimum wage. "I can sell em to ya, I can't tell you anything about them" was my catchphrase.

&#x200B;

Getting rid of the fish was the best thing we ever did.
Walmart? I had a similar experience there. No one knew a thing about fish--customers OR workers--and one coworker even admitted to me that he wouldn't bother feeding the fish if he didn't know what they took. All he knew was the flakes. And he was the department head!

Hardly anyone bought them, and tons of them died. Yet we got more delivered every week.
That’s amazing, more stores should do that.
ive seen that and i dont even work at a pet store. theyll come in asking for the cheapest food not the best food for their dog. or they get mad at prices of tanks and like what do they expect?
Those people just don't think about treating animals like they would want to be treated in the same position. They think "oh won't it be fun to have a cute fish tank or dog" and then get the cheapest stuff just to keep the tank barely in shape or keep the dog fed.
If you think that's bad, you should see the shithead impulse-buyers in the reptile community. They impulse-buy these amazing animals (Burmese Pythons, ball pythons, chameleons, bearded dragons, turtles) and then they neglect them and abuse them for the rest of that animals life. The Burmese Python invasion in Florida literally happened because stupid rich people impulse-bought them as babies without doing any research or knowing how big they would get, then "releasing them" into the Everglades when they grew to their full size. There should be many, many more restrictions on buying pets of all kinds.
They think of it as a chore and not a living thing
Talking (most) people out of pets is easy. 

* "Come smell this ferret/mouse cage"
* Try to pick up dwarf hamster, get bitten
* "Yeah, it is asleep, they do this about 22 hours a day and are only active when you're trying to go to sleep; they're mean when you wake them up."
* "That'll be $178, this should get you started, sirrah"
*  "Yeah, you have to feed it live bugs, you can raise your own or come to the store every week."
* Mist it every day or it dies; let it get too hot and it dies; let it get too cold and it dies; if it swallows some of its bedding it dies

I'm not trying to talk everyone out of it, but in most cases, the people who don't need an animal just don't know enough about it to be able to convince themselves they really don't want it, so you provide them the reasons.
Not that it'll help that much, but there's an actual name for what you're experiencing. It's called [Emotional Labor]
Seriously, the concept of "always smile! It's not that hard!" is such bull. Like no, Debbie, my cat died this morning and my boss still expected me in this afternoon. so EXCUSE ME for crying at the front desk. I'll happily call my manager for you, maybe I'll get fired on the spot and I can go home for the rest of the week.
This is one thing that gets me all the time. I have resting bitch face, and I just hate my job and by the day it seems to get worse because corporate is just a bunch of money grubbing cock suckers who have never actually worked in the establishment once. It's only a matter of time before some dumbass customer complains. For all they know my mother was just diagnosed with cancer, and they're going to possibly get me fired because they see me in the kitchen doing my job, but I'm not super happy? Like fk that entitlement. I have every right to be unhappy and it has absolutely nothing to do with them. They have no say over me or what I do. If I'm unhappy because you brought your stupid, whining kids into the place where I am forced to listen to them cry while you ignore them and feed them shit versus cooking at home like an actual parent would, you don't get to dictate that I cannot judge you or be upset at the extra ten fking sandwiches I now have to make, with whatever bullshit ridiculous demands you have. You don't need that much food. Don't come through the fking drive through and order forty fking junior bacon cheeseburgers. I get it has "junior" in the name so it's a small sandwich, but it's forty fking sandwiches in the drive through that if the time goes too high my bosses get mad at me not at you.

I think maybe I need a new job. I wasn't even close to being done typing but I have to stop myself here. There's just too much.
I used to hate when my mom would get mad at someone in the drive through or a server because they weren't smiling or constantly peppy! That person is working a job you don't own them. I had to threaten that I would never eat out with her again unless she cut it out.
It's so exhausting. 

For at least my first year after starting retail I'd go to bed and close my eyes and instead of sleeping I'd be caught in an endless cyclic hallucination of work and customers and angry conversations. I'd know it wasn't real but couldn't snap out of it. 

Thankfully I got away. I hope you do too :)
Introverts rise up. I meant hide out.
Autobots- ROLL OUT
Cheat Commandos, Rock Rock On!
I'm an introvert, but quite comfortable talking to people THAT I KNOW.  I worry constantly about what to say, being boring etc.

So I tell these people I'm an introvert which is why I don't do X and Y (like talking to random people at a bar on holiday or something), and they ALWAYS go "No way, you're not an introvert."

Uhhhh yes I am, just because I talk to you fine doesn't mean you know what's going on in my head.  Do you have any idea what my anxiety is like during silences?!
So often I want to have a shitty day becoming recluse or distant. Soaking in my drudge of emotions and thoughts is all I want. It is in these moments that I hate my ability to talk. 

I can’t just not respond to you if you start talking to me. Before I’m aware of what’s happening, I’ve been talking thirty minutes to you and I’m laughing. I’m fking laughing.  I walk away from the conversation pissed at my inner being.
I do that too, which often causes problems in business. Others don't want to make friends (they have enough in their private life), they want my money, effort or knowledge.

I've found that it's OK to go inwards provided it's done in shorter intervals, so that things that need to get done (despite being 100% tedious) are handled and without any need for panic due to time crunch or scope.
Imagine being an introvert that spends there day having to talk and sell products to people. 

That’s me. 


When I get home from work, I shut down and shut off.
I always tell people I’m an introvert living an extroverts life...When you make a living by talking to people it can be mentally exhausting.
I work as a bartender and everyone is blown away that on my days off, I literally leave my house to walk my dog and that’s the extent of my social interaction.
This, but to be even more specific sales. Was excellent at it but hated my life.
Public speaking.   


When I was younger I used to do stuff nobody else wanted to do just for it to be over with. Started with school presentations. Same thing happened in college with group projects. Then, in a company I work for, I still am the dedicated speaker most of the time. Because: "it's easy for you", "you speak loudly and clearly", "you do it well". Or so it seems.

I hate it.

It's goddamn exhausting. I usually need days of mental preparation. I'm an introvert, so it literally drains life out of me every single time. But nobody ever believes me, because I'm pretty outgoing and loud sometimes so "there's no way you're introverted".

Stupid public speaking.

EDIT: Awww thanks for silver kind strangers!
> "it's easy for you", "you speak loudly and clearly", "you do it well"

aka "I really, really, really don't want to do it, so I'm going to butter you up and try and force you to do it instead."
Or, yknow, they genuinely think that OP is good at what they do because they've had years and years of practice in a subject where many feel uncomfortable.
Not always, there was this huge project in one of my last college courses, there was a guy like the poster, he really was good at speaking and explaining things, he wasn't that good at the rest, but his speaking skills really carried our presentations
I can relate.

I have terrible social anxiety and at university we often do these seminars where we split into groups and then a spokesperson reports back to the whole class. Normally we break into groups and no one says anything, which I hate because then the lecturer puts us on the spot at the end of the class, so I normally chip in one thing just to break the awkward silence. Then, because I'm the only one who's said anything, they all volunteer me to speak and I have to make up some bullshit on the spot because no one else has pitched in any ideas.

What really annoys me is how a lot of the Chinese students can speak flawless English right up until you ask them for ideas, then it's "Very sorry. No understand English." while they sit there on Tik Tok.
My public speaking teacher in college said I would be a good fit for doing frequent public speaking later in my life/career.

I never told him that I was actually terrified of public speaking and just got high as a kite to relax me before every speech I had to do in his class.
Socializing. Everyone thinks Im so outgoing and friendly but in reality, it wears me down mentally & physically to the point I start drinking alcohol just to be able to keep up the charade. It's exhausting and I hate it but I have to fake it to make a living
Same!!! I started working remotely for this reason and I have WAY more energy now. My home office is very peaceful and productive
ugghh I want a remote job sooo bad. I'm in an appropriate field for it, but I'm having a hard time landing a position that I want. I'm slowly trying to work from home more in my current position but it'd be so nice to work for a place that is 100% remote
For me it's one of them 'can live with it, can't live without it' kind of things. I go mad on my own but I find a big percentage of people mean, manipulative, deceitful, or just annoying. People only seem to care about themselves. Everyone wants something off you.

I never use to feel this way.
[deleted]
Yeah, problem with me is I tend to try and keep people happy to avoid hassle because I wanted an easy life. Barbeques and holidays with a girlfriend no kids. People have seen this as an opportunity to take advantage of me to get me to solve there problems and it's left ME in the shit. I've been taken advantage of and the only way to fix that is to avoid them people and try and correct them mistakes.
Ok but that friend is trash
I've become pretty disillusioned as well lately. Try to help people wherever I go and yet I feel underappreciated and not well liked in spite of my efforts. 

Sometimes I want to stop taking all of my meds, do some lsd and close myself in a craft room to pursue the long list of projects I have waiting. Nobody would notice my absence until they needed a thing I normally provide.
“I’d love to stay and chat, but I have something scheduled tonight, so I really have to get going.”

“What are you doing tonight?”

*pulls out day planner*

“See? 8PM-6AM: wrap self in comforter and cry while in bed. Got a long night in front of me, so I better get to it. I kinda want to get an early start.”
It's called the confident introvert. Yes you have the skills and the power but social activities drain the battery. And than you need to recharge alone.
Yup, know a ton of people who fit this category. Great social skills, good emotional IQ and empathy, charismatic speaker, just doesn't actually like talking to people for too long.

I even married one. Early in our relationship I was a bit confused why she would ghost me for a few days at a time, especially after dates that went well, and I later discovered she just needed a break/reset from being so damn charming every time we met up.
Tolerating irrational behavior.
So then to sum it up.... Parenting?
Or dealing with insane parents
Dealing with humans in general
Cake decorating. I really do enjoy it for the most part but people just expect me to make them, for nothing. Few people are like oh.. We'll pay for ingredients. Cheers, but what youve asked for will take me at least two days and ive barely met you.. random friend of Family member.

Actually.. I think i just hate people.

Edit: Ah, cheers for love guys and the award!!
Woodworker here. Friends ask me all the time, "Hey u/jkatzmoses can you make me x?" I always answer yeah let's setup a meeting and discuss specifics so I can write you a proposal. Did you have a budget in mind? Usually something like costs between  $x and $x. Then wait to see if they follow up to set a meeting. 1 out of 10 follow through.
That's what I wanted to write. During my training, I used to make money on the side by mounting kitchens on the weekends. When some people got wind of this, they expected me to do it for free. For friends who were moving i did it, of course, but when co-workers started asking, I told them an hourly price. They never asked again.
I mount kitchens for a living and my prices for people I know  are always too high. Why? Because then they expect me to go back and adjust doors and service the kitchen for free while i would be paid for every call.
Normally I charge $100/hour, but for friends and family I have a discounted rate of $150/hour.
I charge 10-20% of the kitchen price. So basically a 10 000$ kitchen would cost them 1000$ for me to install it. A kitchen that price is easily done in a day
Fine, we'll do it your way.  I normally charge about 15% of the price of the kitchen, but for friends and family I only charge 22.5%.  What a steal!
am ignorant: what does mounting kitchens mean?  Hanging cabinets?

edit: kinky
fking cupboards
diddling drawers
molesting microwaves
reaming refrigerators
Teasing toasters
stroking stovetops
Not OP, but I think in some countries it’s common for them to pack and take the kitchen with them when they move cabinets and all, I know some Scandinavian countries also take their floors with them. 

I think this is what he may be referring to.
Thank you for the honest answer.  These others are funny but yours actually explains the issue and why I'm confused.
Right. This is in Germany, where there's normally no furniture in the House when you move in. In most cases, you buy your own kitchen and take it along when you move out, including the stove, sink, dishwasher and fridge.
Hung cabinets are the ones I like to mount.
That’s a great pitch, meeting to do a proposal helps show the “friend” what’s really a involved in doing a project and even if it is just time, your time has value.
Yep, make it clear that there is a price up front. Most people who were expecting free work will drop it at that point.
As soon as that family members stops describing what they want, tell them "ok cool, so I'll need around XX dollars to make this, for the ingredients and two days of work". That's it. be upfront.
"Let me know if you decide you still want it" as they walk away. Chances are they won't be back.
I feel this is like the bakery equivalent of people that draw as a hobby... Recently I asked a friend to draw/design the new tattoo I'm getting and she wasn't expecting any payment at all, because before me, friends of hers have requested drawings (far more complex than mine) as a favor and don't pay anything.

Like man, it's time, energy, etc etc, I can't figure out for the life of me why people think it's ok to 'exploit' someone else's hobby (or something they are good at) for free...

Edit. I was just saying an example of 'drawing as a hobby' because it was the first thing that came to my mind and I have several artist friends who suffer from this. I'm aware that it affects a lot more of people with art related and crafting stuff, sorry for not including all of them.

Also, thanks for the silver kind stranger, my first ever award on reddit :)
Why not just ask the tattoo artist to design it?  That is pretty much their entire job.
Oh, the artist is another friend of mine, I did ask her first but she couldn't make it because she works full time on marketing and the tattoo thing is a side job, so I asked another friend for it :)
Just make sure her kitchen is clean and she wears gloves and new needles, at least.
She works in a studio! It's a side thing, yeah, but she's not bad at it and actually has a place in a legit studio don't worry lol
Photographer here. 

“Well you can drive an hour to our band meet and we will let you photograph us. Get it? You can listen to us playing and meanwhile do your hobby. For free! Isn’t that great?”

Oh god.
Human nature is to be greedy. By having a close relationship or a very distant relationship with someone, humans tend to feel justified in “asking for a favor” with no expectation of paying because, “they’ll return the favor later”. The issue is, they never return the favor.
Many people simply aren't aware of the time it would take for you to do their sketch or decorate their cake or whatever else. Their only experience in watching someone do it was a timelapsed YouTube video that was only 20 minutes long. Talk to them about how long it will actually take you to complete the work, and how much of an effort it is to do. If they continue asking for free favours,  then they are trying to exploit you. Generally though, they dont know its exploitation beforehand.
Honestly, start coming up with a list of items that you could do on a cake and how much you would charge based on that. Explain that while it's a great way to express yourself, it does take time and energy, and you have other things that need to get done.
Or say that you do it as a side business and just give them pricing up front
And if they say, "But we're family"

Apologize for not giving them the Friends and Family Rate, say you'll correct that, and double your price.
the problem is the family member has likely blown the shit out of their cover, "oh OP is *so good* at decorating cakes they could do it professionally and just love to do it for fun!! no you should definitely ask them to work for you for free!"
So just announce to everyone that you've started a side business doing cakes.
[deleted]
If you've learned anything from r/choosingbeggars, you'll be considered an ignorant snob
For anyone who doesn’t understand this comment - you’ll be considered an ignorant snob by the choosing beggars (entitled people)
I think this happens with any profession or hobby.
IT guy checking in. Can confirm.
This is what I don't understand about my mom. She's decorating cakes too. She also makes cakes for other people like family, neighbor's, colleagues... but she never asks for money. Not even the costs for the ingredients, even though my dad and I always tell her she should at least take 15 € or something for them.

And then, wile decorating the cake, she's complaining about how much work it is and about how many people ask her for a cake...
If she'd take money she would probably have less work.
Math
At least you have the compensation of being good at it...
[deleted]
Same I never had any trouble understanding it but fking god it is boring
Some of math (lots of it, actually) can be fascinating and beautiful. 

Unfortunately, that's not how it's usually taught -- it's all multiplication tables, trigonometric formulas, and so on. 

When Maxwell was coming up with the formulae to describe Faraday's discoveries in electromagnetism, he noticed that the changing magnetic fields would induce changing electrical fields, and that the changing electrical fields would induce changing magnetic fields -- and so on. He realized that these waves would propogate, and calculated the speed at which this would happen.

He got the speed of light.

But nobody knew what light actually was.

Or, rather, nobody *else* knew what light actually was.

Math can be cool.
> it's all multiplication tables

I used to knock this as well until I tutored (Algebra) a 19 year old girl in college, who had to do 6 x 7 on her fingers. Not everything has to be step-by-step shown work. Sometimes memorizing the simple shit speeds up the more complicated ones.
Then you get to higher level calculus and your brain is so fried that 6x7 is much easier to type into your calculator than use your head.
Physics is just crystal math. :)
I failed calculus twice before in college until I got a professor that actually liked math.  He explained not just how to do things but why it worked that way and what it was useful for.  This is when I started actually enjoying it.
Yeah math was always my strongest subject in school. I was skipped ahead 3 years in math and was the highest scoring member of our school’s competitive math team. I think I even set a state record in that math competition but this was decades ago so I’m not sure.

But I just didn’t care about it at all! It’s fun being good at it, I guess, but math just didn’t inspire any real excitement in me. 

Once I got to college, I took the most basic math class to fulfill a requirement and never looked back. And now I’m an English major! Reading and writing is just so much more fulfilling to me, even if it’s more challenging, partly because it’s so subjective. I think I didn’t like how black-and-white math always felt.
> I think I didn’t like how black-and-white math always felt.

I feel like this is a massive failing of the education system. I'd argue mathematics is one of the most creative subjects at its higher levels. But students just don't get to see any of it until maybe the last year of undergrad.
It is absolutely taught wrong. I was told not to be a programmer because I hated and was bad at math. At the same time I'm acing physics... 

Fast forward 20 years and I go back to college and realize I'm actually really good at math and just loathe rote memorization and monotony or tedium...
Cooking
This is why I’m not a fan of the “do what you love and you’ll never work a day of your life” quote. 

There are many enjoyable hobbies (even side gigs) that become miserable grinds when you have to make a living out of it.
One of the things though is you find that you weren't quite as into a thing as you found. Sometimes that is in fact true; the best mechanics for example are the ones that love working on cars so much they'd be doing it all day anyway. Then they find out that people will not just bring cars to them but also pay them to work on them! Holy shit! Dream come true!!! A lot of the time you get people thinking "boy I sure do like painting, it'd be awesome to do it for a living" then finding out all the bullshit that comes along with that. Suddenly you can't just paint whatever you feel like you have to be paying attention to what other people want. Cooking was mentioned already and a great many people love to cook but find out that restaurant work is massively different from cooking at home.

There's some truth to that quote but you have to make sure that doing things professionally is the same as doing it for fun. For a great many things the differences are massive.
This. My old job was fry cooking. I would always make customers’ orders the best. There were many times where the customers would wear me down. 

>Can I get a medium sized wrap?

>You got it!

*At the register*

>Um? I said I wanted a small size and I said no sauce! Can you remake it please??

>Sure. Apologies. 

*Snatches food from me with a pissed off look and gives a 1 star review*
Just use Gordon's tactics and tell em,"FUCK OFF, WILL YA!"
You joke, but yelp and google reviews have worn local businesses down to the point where they no longer care.  I had one  customer who left a 3000 word essay about my horrible customer service.  I simply responded with "California customer".  I have a 4.7 star rating, and I honestly couldn't give a shit less.
This is SO fking true. What is it with customer reviews from California people who announce "I'm from California so I know <insert food here>"? Some random California white gals (and 80% of the time, they're gals for some reason) tear down my local Pho place in Yelp, meanwhile my Vietnamese coworker, friends, and neighbors flock to it and tell me it's like a taste of home. If a reviewer mentions they're from California, I pretty much treat that as an "I can safely disregard this review" flag.

Nobody gives a shit you're from California, Karen.
Spent the last 10 years of my life as a chef. Never again.
That’s too long to deal with that bullshit. I did ~5 and couldn’t take it anymore. All the best to you friend
Could you please elaborate more? I am really curious about the down side of it.
The hours are brutal. The pay is worse.   Say goodbye to having a normal work schedule let alone a weekend.  You can’t count on half the crew being able to show up on time let alone sober or not hungover. And god forbid Johnny Xanax makes it one day without falling asleep cutting onions or fking up every order dragging the rest of the team further behind. Takes a while to make your way up the ladder and the top is the only place to even have a chance making decent money. You’re constantly on your feet sweating and feeling the wrath of the oven/fryer/stove/grill. Oh you’re sick?  Bet your ass you’re going into work cuz missing that one day is gonna fk your paycheck, not to mention you’ll have to bring a doctors note if you’re sick and call out. Insurance? Yeah fking right. 

I’d tell anyone and everyone to stay far away from working in a kitchen.
I am sorry about that mate. but thanx for sharing, there are so many myths about being a chef, is good to know the real true.
I've seen those job postings online. 

"Experienced chef wanted for busy restaurant in downtown Huntington Beach, competitive pay offered" (they actually mean $12/hr)
Cleaning shrimps. My wife likes them but hates cleaning them after they done. So she asks me to it every time.
I am god and magician at that (at least I think I am), cuz I can clean a bowl of shrimps in like a minute or 2. But I fking hate to clean them
"Ugh. Why do you have to de-turd these things?"
Still got that meat lovers pizza in the trunk
Technically you could just eat shit instead.
I never devein shrimp. I don't care, I'm already eating a sea cockroach.
[deleted]
Your wife sounds like my toddler
....Is your wife a small child?
Yeah I was with them for the shrimp thing that can be tedious, maybe the fruit thing.  But cutting up the meat???
No shit.  If my wife demanded that I cut up her steak before she would eat it.... we wouldn't have gotten married.  I don't care how good she is in bed, she's not a little kid, and I'm not going to cut up her food for her...
Yeah the cooking part is fine, not everyone is good at cooking steak and it's not something you wanna mess up.  But cutting it up for her?  Plus why even bother with the ribs just make pulled pork.  u/krankie what is going on lol
Are you also breastfeeding her?
Bro... stop doing that.
Wow, most people stop having someone cut up their food for them when their age is in the single digits.
Unless your wife is physically incapable, she REALLY needs to do that shit for herself
Video editing.

I like everything about it but maaan does it take a lot of time and concentration. It can get pretty tedious sometimes. Usually if I have to do tedious stuff - music helps a lot, but you can't listen to music while editing. Unless you have music in video, in which case you listen to the same song for hours, most of the time listening to the same 1.7 second loops of it.

I love results of editing, love finding ways to get my message across but GOD DAMMIT it takes a lot of time to make something good.

**Edit:** I just spent 4 hours reading comments instead of editing a video for an asbestos removal service (yes, my personal "Citizen Cane"!). **Thanks you guys, you made my day!**

Edit 2: Dear anonymous redditor! You sexy marvel! Thanks!

Edit 3: Woo, more gold! Cheers!

I can do an r/pan stream of me editing, if you guys want. Or! Or I can work on the idea for a youtube channel that I had for a while now. (Don't think I'll get much done with the asbestos video tonight anyways. I'd rather lick an asbestos wall without my safety goggles on.)
Writing music is kinda similar when you are finalizing the project. you are agonizing over the same 4 or 8 bars and listening to them over and over and over and over until it seems right. And then when you think it’s right and call it done, you listen to it somewhere else and realize it’s not right. Damnit. (I love writing music though. But the editing sometimes argh)

Edit: grammar and words
And the metronome follows you even after putting down the monitors. Tik tik tik tok,aaaarrrggghhh
I actually developed a pretty bad drinking problem because it made the whole process of making music a lot more pleasant and relaxed.  It's still so tempting to grab a drink when I'm having writers block or a lack of energy. Definitely understand why so many musicians/artists have problems with alcohol and drugs.
Ugh, I hear you. "Okay, this sounds great on my speakers; I'm gonna render it and check it out on my headphones." \*some minutes later\* "Oh, cool, it's a muddy mess! I guess I'll throw my computer out the window and quit forever."
How to edit a video:

step 1: waste 3 hours to find good music

step 2: waste another 3 hours to try every single effect you already tried before on every single clip

step 3: actually do some editing

step 4: crash the programm and realise you forgot to save, so back to step 3 again

step 5: rendering

step 6: find and fix mistakes you made after you already rendered the project

step 7: step 5 again

step 8: ???

step 9: profit
You forgot the last step, 10: Watch other video made by someone else, look at your project, throw it in the trash and start over.
"This looks good!" 2 days pass. "This looks garbage!"
\> my parents right after my birth
Happy cake day !
/r/suicidebywords
This was my editing for fun, so minus the 9th step,I can fully confirm the process. Also happy cake day!
Well I mean... a finished videoproject for the family for example is still some kind of profit
Video editing and animation are two of the few things that manage to beat my ADhD. I can sit for hours cropping fractions-of-seconds to make a frames synch perfectly with the music, cut smoothly or just "feel right".
Hyperfocus is a symptom of ADHD. We struggle to focus on normal tasks, but spend wayyy too much time on things that we find enjoyable.
Yep that’s me. I can spend literally 10-15 hours in a row watching or playing something I really like or say typing a research paper with 100% focus. However otherwise I can also go like an entire hour without being able to concentrate on something if my mind just decides to be like that. I’m ADD not ADHD tho
I get this a lot. I've recently got into video editing too, and it's super satisfying. But dear God, it's tedious
I've wanted to do some YouTube videos and the idea of trying to edit them sounds like such a PITA.
I did let's plays for a bit. Playing a game (And dying to get back to it) for like an hour to do 2-4 hours of editing is so discouraging. Especially when you get like one or two views and one of them might be your mom.
Video editing to music? Fun.

Video editing with only speech or no sound? Ugh.
So....this was my answer too and I pretty much resigned to not comment because who tf else would say that and yet...

I had a 15 year career as an editor for tv, movies, and then video games. Awards and everything. It was fun and fulfilling. 

But now I sit in front of an NLE and I’m overwhelmed by the tediousness of it all.
My job lol.
This right here. I saw your other comment and am sorry you don't get the credit you deserve. I'm on the other end. I just hate my job, but am really good at what I do. I get recognized frequently for it. I just....it's work. I want my $$$ and forget about my job when I go home
This is exactly me. I'm very good at my job, my work constantly recognizes how appreciative they are of me. When I go on vacation they all brace themselves for a terrible week. I always show up, I can accomplish things in half the time of anyone else that has ever done my job, and yet I hate it....It's work. I'd rather be on my back deck with a beer, grilling a big steak and listening to music in the sun. 

  
I believe a lot of my resentment stems from how reliant my work is on me. I don't even find my job hard but when I'm not there I know things are going sideways and it bothers me the whole time, and I always worry about what kind of mess I will return to clean up.
I also choose this guys deck, beer, music, sun, and steak.
How come, what do you do?
Like I work my ass off but don't get enough credit imo. So I end up being less motivated and kinda hate it now.
Time to move on.
Yeah I'm currently looking for other jobs.
Good for you dude, wish you the best of luck
Sorry to hear that, what’s your work?
Mechanic for big trucks.
Same here. I have tried to train people to replace me but no one ever sticks.
So you can't leave your current job because of that?
Healing in Overwatch and reaching the top shelf
Healing in general... I'm so good at it that I can manage a raid group of HP bars while doing mechanics and raid calling for my group, even managing to call out individual players who are about to do them wrong, but fk me, I would rather just hit the damn boss and only give a shit about my own damage.
Funny how everybody has different perspectives on this. I find healing in any game to be super calming, and DPS to be a stressfest. Overwatch is a very good example
I don't find being the main focus of enemy flankers who can sometimes insta-kill you out of nowhere and being the subject of [*this*] to be very calming
Yeah, that bit isn't fun for sure. Getting leapt on by a Tracer or Genji and getting demolished definitely isn't a barrel of laughs. But the day to day of supporting I find very calming - healing, but also shot calling, ult tracking and such - to be much more calming than playing Damage. My aim is pretty shitty, so when I play Damage I spend the majority of my time missing shots and having my team question my sexuality
I personally prefer dps but I respect all the people that enjoy healer out there and the only one I can play decently is Lucio (who has much better counterparts on the healing side)

Also funny way to label the people who call you gay just for making a mistake, yet most of them jump right in the middle of a six stack alone and blame the healer for not following them in there.
Blowjobs
There’s a reason they don’t call them “blowjoys”
I had to scroll way too far down to find this correct answer.
I always wonder if people that don't like doing this discuss the reasons with their partner.

For example, if you said I don't like blowjobs because your junk always smells and tastes bad, you have hair everywhere, you always wanna force my head and go in my mouth.

If said person were willing to clean themselves up, be nice and trimmed, and make it more fun for the other person and listen to their needs I'd imagine they'd get a lot more of them.

Sadly a lot of people don't ever think about it from the other person's perspective.
This. Too many dudes want to treat the other person's mouth like a pocket pussy. I'll pass, thanks. If it's a deal breaker then find someone else.
Are you my wife?
Nah, she's no good.
Seriously.  She's gotten so much better over time, and they get so much less frequent over time.  I don't get it.
Quality over quantity, my man.
You do need *some* quantity, else you just have nothing.
I like giving head a lot, and I'm apparently pretty great at it, but guys who take like a million years to nut (and that seems to be a *lot* of guys) make it really tedious in the long run.

And the ones who just like to start thrusting their dks down your throat without warning. Like, thanks, I just love feeling like I'm about to vomit during sex.
username checks out
A guy secret that I'm gonna let you in on is you could be terrible at it and we'd still say your amazing, this is so were more likely to get another in the future.
Nah fk that. No BJ is better than a dry/toothy/unenthusiastic BJ.
Lying. I'm specially good at lying, so good that I can make myself believe it's truth in a way that it helps me mantain the lie forever. However, I hate lying and I don't do it unless I can classify it as a "white lie".
Anything other than a white lie guilts me forever
If you tell yourself a lie enough it becomes the truth
I don't think so, if I keep telling myself the sky is green, it'll still be yellow at the end of it
Procrastinating.

I'm very good at putting things off until the last minute and wasting time.
Last minute? Amateur. Try putting things off until after the deadline and hoping to God it still gets accepted. 

Or *indefinitely*.
Hahahaha, rookie. Ask the teacher for a 2 week extension and still dont start by the next deadline
Reading all of these comments is giving me Vietnam flashbacks to when I was in high school. I was the king of extensions and turning shit in late for full credit. My dad worded it perfectly back then: “If you put 1/4 of the effort into doing your schoolwork as you did into thinking of excuses for why it was late, you’d have a full ride scholarship to any college you wanted.”
You weren't really the king of extensions. Your teacher was just very nice.
Depends how good his excuses were. Medical caretaking is hard to beat.
Really? I pass late ALL the time.
Yes and the worst thing is (probably also for you) that I pretty much excel in doing something when I barely have any time left. Which makes me never really getting punished for procrastinating.
Same here. I got a research paper published in a peer reviewed journal when I was a Bachelor's student. I wrote that paper the night before the deadline.
I'm good at music, people like my songs and I love coming up with melodies, but I hate recording them.

I'm crap at performing, playing guitar, singing, whatever I'm doing, so I have to do hundreds of takes just to do the simplest thing properly and then after finally getting it all together and trying to mix it all myself, I think: "Meh, sounds ok."

I go away and when I come back the next day I realise that, actually, it does indeed sound shit. It *never* sounds how I thought it did when I  last heard it.

So yeah, it's an arduous, thankless task for something I'm apparently doing for "fun".
This is my problem as well. I have nothing but good reactions when i play my songs for people. But when i record them. I feel like it was a waste and doesnt represent how it felt singing the sonng
Yea same, a song can sound awesome in my head but when it's recorded it just bores me stiff to listen to it. We need a way to record how it actually sounds in our head while we're imagining it, I'm thinking some sort of electrode hat...
Man I’m kind of the opposite. I love recording & really know my way around a DAW, but I hate that I can’t actually come up with proper melodies to record in the first place.
Singing.. so same.
I actually love to sing.  And I’m married to a musician and collaborating with him is lots of fun.
But when people find out I can.. then they automatically want to put me on the spot or in front of a crowd.  But I’m one of those people who detest being the center of attention.  (My husband says he is the same way... but has no problem playing and singing live in front of huge crowds.  He loves it.)
I would rather record backing vocals for him in the basement studio and then let him use them on a pedalboard and leave me out of the entertainment part.
being alone. Im really good at just not making plans and watching a movie/watching shit on youtube or just casually do some shit while listening to music. Its some sort of comfort thing but after doing it for 10 years-ish i have gotten to good and now i often feel really lonely and sad.
It's true. I'm going to die alone, because I'm just so good at:
1. Isolating myself (I have been since I was a child)
2. Avoiding social obligations
3. Procrastination

At the same time, I am really bad at:
1. Tending to my needs (I still eat and sleep ok, but I could be better in many ways)
2. Reaching out to people 
3. Taking advantage of good opportunities (really broad, I know, but I've missed a lot of chances to make a better life because I'm just not aware the door is even there until it is closed)
Defusing arguments. I'm often the "judge and jury" friend or people come to me to ask if they're being irrational. I'm almost always the first person to apologize and come up with a compromise or solution.
Of course it's good to mitigate anger and drama, but some people take advantage of the fact that I'll bounce back and "fix" whatever is wrong. Sometimes I feel like I'm not allowed to have emotions and break down for that moment because it will derail the good thing. It's also incredibly emotionally tiring and not enough people ask of it's ok to vent/ask for advice before doing so.
My job. I work in a school district, one on one with SPED kids. Middle schoolers to be specific.

I don't know how much longer I can do this. My sanity is in danger.
I hear you and so so empathize with your struggle. Please prioritize yourself!!! Yes, the kids need someone, especially such an at-risk group, but if you aren’t feeling your best you can’t BE your best. Take your sick days. And if you need to go, don’t feel bad for leaving for good.
Bridal makeup. 

I love doing my makeup and I even like dipping into the SX side of things. So I was a go to for friends looking to save money on their wedding makeup for a while. I quickly learned I hated it . It is not freeing or creative for me and theres too much pressure. There are also time crunches to deal with. 

I won't do bridal makeup anymore. I'll keep playing with makeup in my own bedroom with no time pressure or real need for it to turn out well. That's what I enjoy.
making the bed
Not gonna lie, golf. Every time I go out, either with amateurs or experienced golfers, I get complimented time and again that I’m good at it and should play more. But truth is, I only try to play as efficiently as possible because I find it so fking boring I just want to drive the cart and maybe have a beer and just leave. This sounds like a brag but I assure you, it is not. I don’t like social outings of playing any kind of sport as I’m not a sports guy
To be fair it’s the only sport where the better you are the less you play
Driving a manual transmission car. It was a blast when I was driving my Triumph Spitfire convertible when I was in my 20s. Driving my manual Subaru Forester at age 62...more of a pain in the ass than I thought it would be when I purchased it.
Is this something important? I live in a country with 95% of cars being manual, and people resist changing into automatic. So, I learnt to drive, and actually drive a manual car. Also have a motorbike, and can't imagine driving a motorbike without clutch.

Last year a friend of me was drunk and told me to drive him home in an automatic car.... It took me about 10 minutes to realize I just had to put it on "drive" and drive. It was so strange having to do nothing while driving, I didn't like that experience, I felt dumb, like if the car was doing the funny part for me.
In the USA automatics have been the norm for decades now. It's actually somewhat difficult to find brand new manual transmission vehicles for sale. 

I've mostly driven manuals all my life and I'm in my late 20s, but I can understand the appeal to automatics. I prefer manuals, but sometimes it's nice to just get in and cruise and not think about it. Especially in a vehicle with a heavy/difficult clutch. My old truck had a heavy clutch and there were some days, especially in traffic, where I wish it was an automatic. 

This only worsens with age since things like your legs and such begin to not work so great any more. Or like my mom, who used to drive 18 wheelers in her late 20s, is now in her 60s. She's well versed in how to drive anything ranging from sports cars to hauling 40 tons in a semi across the country. However, now due to her age and bone/muscle problems that come with it, she has difficulty setting the (hand operated) parking brake in my car all the way to where it's barely on and whenever I set it after driving it I have to take it off for her. This really isn't an issue in her car since it's an auto with a foot brake. She also really couldn't drive my old truck well any more even though I know for sure she's driven vehicles with tougher clutches.

I already know when I'm older I'm going to have a shit load of knee problems. So there will come a day when I opt for an automatic for a daily driver and think back fondly on my days with my stick shift cars. Okay, I'll have at least one in my garage that I take out for a cruise on the weekends with. :)
And that's why in my anecdotal evidence people text and drive a lot more in the states because you literally have to do nothing to make the car move
Driving a manual in traffic is like having to remove and put back on your shoes for every step you take.
To each their own ... I have a '14 Mazda 3 manual, and I actually find it somewhat meditative.
The 3rd gen mazda 3s ('14-'19) are a blast. My mom and sister both own the 3 hatchback in manual, a 2014 and 2015. Those are Damn fun little cars, the steering feels like its on rails and the manual makes the relatively weak engine tons of fun. 

That said I'm glad my mazda 6 is an auto. The clutch on the '14 mazda 3 my mom has is so stiff it becomes a serious chore if you get stuck in traffic. I got stuck in stop and go traffic due to construction while on a road trip and after an hour of that my leg had had enough. Before then id never been sore from driving before but my left leg was definitely a bit tender the next day.
It depends on the car imo. My 2017 Civic ext has the lightest and most forgiving clutch I've ever used and I prefer it to a automatic in traffic (I don't have to hit the brakes as often). 

If I was driving my track car to work and I'd go crazy within a week. The clutch is much less forgiving, is hard to push in, and since their is no throttle "padding" so it will buck when you let go of the gas in first or second gear.

Math and procrastination.  I'll tell you guys about it later
Hating myself.
I'm on a 10 year combo streak myself.
Rookie numbers. You gotta pump those numbers up! PUMP EM UP! Im at a wonderful 12. And im 21. Yayyy.....
I’m at 48. 

I’ve hated myself since before my mother was born.
I wish maths would apply here. 
You hate hating yourself? Two negatives make a positive, so you actually love yourself!
Binging shows on Netflix and feeling sad that it all ended so quickly.
Found a way around this. If you suffer a concussion shortly after watching the last episode you'll likely forget the whole thing, getting to enjoy the show again. 


But you need to watch the whole series back to back for this to work.
I kinda hate this binge culture Netflix made popular

I barely remember shows I watched entirely in a day or two and love it, but at same time remember more about shows I watched weekly and didn't like them
I'm pretty good at drawing pet portraits, but as soon as I take commissions I just lose my motivation. You'd think being paid might help, but because I HAVE to do it, it's less interesting.
Actually had this problem with work as well. What I did is basically disconnect my bank account from my work. So I do what I like during the week, and every week money appears in my bank account :). Took me a bit to change my mindset to that, but since we don't really talk about money during work, just initially, it's easirt to do. 

I have to constantly trick myself into different mindsets to be able to do anything. 

For example I fking hate doing the dishes, tomorrow I'll fking hate having to do even more dishes, If I do it now I'm going to hate it less. Might as well clean the kitchen while I'm doing the dishes... Some water dropped in the floor, let me clean it... Might as well clean the floor... Since I have mopped the kitchen, might as well clean the rest. 

All this flawed logic is what I use to do anything I fking hate doing.

I do understand your situation thought. Since it is a customer by customer thing. My only idea would be to get a friend to manage all money dealings, like a "manager".
Drawing from pictures or anything realistic. Super good at it, but realistic art just doesn't interest me.
Empathy. I always feel bad for the smallest things happening to the people around me and it's pretty miserable.
Teaching. I’m currently a teacher and it’s just dreadful to come to school every day with the current state of education in the U.S., specifically inner-city schools. This is actually going to be my last year.

When I told my principal I was leaving, his exact words were “Why?! You’re so good at it!”

I think I deserve to find my passion and purpose in life and unfortunately, this isn’t it.
Motivating others to have a different sex life to the norm. 

I had penile cancer and had the whole organ removed, so as a result I've shared my journey to have a normal sex life on this site and lots of others have told me I've inspired them to have much better, creative sex.  

I don't begrudge the people who I've have advice or motivated one but, but rather I hate that this has all happened to me to have this as something I'm "good at" in the first place. 

I'd much rather be normal, with a boring PIV based sex life over being a dk less guru anyday.
Wait so you don’t have a penis or just the works?
Nope, the whole organ was removed. I still have testicles, a Scrotum on a prostate.
Listening to people. But a lot of people tend to dump emotionally on me because I will sit and listen. As much as I love my friends, it gets exhausting always having friends telling their problems to you, without really being able to vocalise your own problems.
Coding. Parents pushed me towards it as it was the 'future' and I did really well on it. Absolutely hate it to death though.
Driving
Football, got a scholarship at a D1 Top 25 school, but my position killed my love for the game and already burnt me out as a sophomore.
Riddle me this: I'm good at what I hate doing, and I hate what I'm good at. Where am I?
> Where am I?

This is Reddit, so a 50% chance of being on a toilet.
Wow. And I just wiped. And yes I'm constipated, thank you Reddit time stamp.
Get a Squatty Potty.
Life changing.
People told me I’m charismatic and that I’m good with people. 

But that shit just TIRES me the hell out. Not to mention it’s hard as fk for me to start conversations because I’m shy.
customer service

I work at a saas tech company and part of my job is to keep the customers of our most exclusive product happy by supporting them via e-mail and on the phone. For some reason (not to toot my own horn), I am excellent at it, but it drives me absolutely insane. Some people are just... interesting to deal with. Makes me cry real tears sometimes lol
Disappointing people
Any house work. 

If I actually try I can vacuum, wipe down windows, tables and benches really well and get the house looking real good for my parents but if I CBF then nothing will get done on my behalf.
Overthinking
Gaining weight
Not dying. Very good at living, but don't like doing it.
folding fitted sheets
Studying. Actually i can be a really good student without studying a lot. I understand stuff very easily and people say i am really kind of charismatic at this. I am just lazy af so my grades arent at the level they are supposed to be.
If you're thinking of going to college, unfortunately you need to force yourself to study and get good at studying. At a certain point raw intelligence isn't enough. Some people it hits in high school, but in college is when it hits more intelligent kids. 

Unfortunately no amount of intelligence is going to help you properly process 1000 pages in a week. You need to study regularly to be able to do that.

Good news is, that if you're smart and do study small amounts regularly throughout the year (review notes after class, weekly summaries, summaries of summaries, answer practice exam questions after finishing a chapter/topic), it's likely you'll have to study very little come exam time
Being socially awkward
My job
There's plenty of things for me. I can get phone calls at all hours of the day from friends or family asking what I think is wrong with there car. Or doing anything tech related. Same thing applies to that too. Yes I may understand how things work way better than most people but don't fking call me when I'm at work or at midnight. Just fk off please.
