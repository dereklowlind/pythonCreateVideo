The second and third coats are lightweight. Again, less is more. Also, run the knife over the the first coat before the next (2-3) coats to knock down any boogers. Don’t worry about inconsistencies with the lightweight because it sands down easily (if you suck at it). If you can work the knives in order to feather the outer edges you should be good.

What I did is basically disconnect my bank account from my work. So I do what I like during the week, and every week money appears in my bank account :). Took me a bit to change my mindset to that, but since we don't really talk about money during work, just initially, it's easirt to do. \n\nI have to constantly trick myself into different mindsets to be able to do anything. \n\nFor example I fucking hate doing the dishes, tomorrow I'll fucking hate having to do even more dishes, If I do it now I'm going to hate it less. Might as well clean the kitchen while I'm doing the dishes... Some water dropped in the floor, let me clean it... Might as well clean the floor... Since I have mopped the kitchen, might as well clean the rest. \n\nAll this flawed logic is what I use to do anything I fucking hate doing.\n\nI do understand your situation thought. Since it is a customer by customer thing. My only idea would be to get a friend to manage all money dealings, like a \"manager\".","isChecked":false,"level":2,"score":"17"},{"author":"Stargazer-14","body":"Drawing from pictures or anything realistic.
