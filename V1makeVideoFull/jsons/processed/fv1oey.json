Even if I had a headache and obviously needed a cigarette I'd  feel ill if I stepped in to the back yard and lit up. I'd have to go for a drive or just deal with the headache.  \n\nAnyway, I had tried to quit several times and always failed. I came up with a new strategy - I saved up all my vacation time and sick days for an entire year and used them leading up to my hire anniversary when I'd get more days and used all of those, too. I went on a long road trip with my wife who I really never smoked around and got out of my regular environment and changed my routine.  \n\nEverything was fine until my first day back to work.

It sparked and sparked and sparked and finally spit out a tiny globe of flame, but it was fickle and went back out. It was low on gas and too cold to light. I held it against the warm air coming out of my dash vents, but it wouldn't light. I rubbed it in my hands for what seemed like an eternity and it still wouldn't light. I felt like I was dying - I needed my nicotine but I couldn't get it. I looked at my hot cup of coffee and knew it was the only way. I dipped my dirty ass lighter in and warmed it up enough to light. I inhaled a tiny gulp of smoke and it was 6 weeks old and stale and nasty and burned my lungs and kicked off a coughing fit. I tried another drag, slowly, gently, but it was so nasty I couldn't stop coughing. I abruptly took an offramp and coughed until the light turned green and didn't go, it went red and green again and I was still coughing. I turned on to the street and pulled in to a parking lot and coughed until I was dry heaving. A drink would have been great, but my coffee had a slight sheen of nasty old lighter funk floating on the surface and the thought of drinking it made me gag harder.

But now she isn't. Now she keeps getting worse and worse. She sleeps, wakes up to throw up, and she goes back to sleep. She is back in hospice and isn't doing well at all. This is her third round with cancer, but we are nearing the end of her fight. We don't know when, only that it will likely be sometime soon. Me and her (plus our other best friend) have been super closer since we were babies. We are teenagers now, but that is part of what makes me so mad. We are only teenagers. I know not everyone gets that long and we should feel lucky for what time we do have, but we were supposed to go to college and be roommates and then eventually start families of our own and then our kids would be raised like sisters and brothers together. We were supposed to have so much time and so many adventures left. We were supposed to grow old and then travel the world together and be crazy and hilarious like the old ladies from Mamma Mia. She isn't supposed to die of cancer. This isn't how the story was supposed to go. I guess to often we forget that we are not the painter of our fate, but rather the canvas.

In truth, what happened could very easily be seen as a dream. In fact, the moment I tell you this happened when I was asleep is probably enough for you to start doubting already. But nevertheless, here goes...\n\nTwo years ago, on a seemingly normal night, I went to bed and fell asleep rather quickly. This in itself is unusual for me as I‚Äôm a bit of an insomniac. But moving on... I awoke feeling very refreshed and went to check my phone to observe the time, but it wasn‚Äôt there. In fact, I quickly noticed I wasn‚Äôt in my room at all. I was in someone else‚Äôs room.\n\nNow, this is the bit that‚Äôs hard to convince you on, but at the time this didn‚Äôt feel like a dream. I am no stranger to lucid dreaming and sleep paralysis, etc, but this was nothing like that. This felt 100% real. I remember feeling very afraid and quickly assumed I must have sleepwalked, but then realised that was practically impossible so started to think I‚Äôd been abducted for some insane reason. \n\nBut then I heard her voice and the sound of a door slamming. I couldn‚Äôt make out what it was, but it seemed as though she was saying hello to a pet in the other room. And I know this part might seem soppy, but I felt instantly calmed on hearing her voice. In like a trance, I slowly sat up and then I noticed a mirror right next to the bed to my left. I looked into the mirror and saw someone who didn‚Äôt look like me. I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve ever heard of the 90‚Äôs show ‚ÄúQuantum Leap‚Äù, but I honestly thought I‚Äôd leaped into another man‚Äôs body like Sam Beckett did in the show. \n\nBut then when I looked closer, I realised it actually was me. I looked slightly older, my hair was darker and I had facial stubble, but it was still me. I could tell because of my eyes mostly. What I heard next confirmed it, because the woman then called my name and told me she was back from wherever it was she‚Äôd gone to. \n\nI looked towards the door, and suddenly got the feeling that something was wrong regarding my time zone. It felt as though I was in the future. There was lights around the door, and the cupboard opened itself automatically when I took a step towards it. And then the door opened by itself and there she stood.\n\nOn seeing her I felt this sudden pull. This need for her. It was an alien feeling to me. I‚Äôd never felt so drawn to a woman in all my life. She wasn‚Äôt really stunning looking, but she was very pretty and the way she looked at me (with slight bemusement mixed with tenderness) made me melt.\n\nSuddenly, everything made sense to me on some kind of strange level. It was as though the other version of myself that I‚Äôd ‚Äúleaped‚Äù into half came back, because I suddenly felt like I knew her. \n\nShe continued to look puzzled, but I didn‚Äôt say anything. I just walked towards her and kissed her and she started to laugh. I began to trace my fingers up her back and she said ‚Äúyou know what that does to me‚Äù and giggled and then...well, skipping the gratuitous parts, we made love. And it just felt so real. So, so real. I know I‚Äôve used the word before but it‚Äôs true. It was real.\n\nWhen the lovemaking ceased, I got up and just looked at myself in the mirror and she just laid on her back asking what had suddenly got into me. I remember asking her the time, not really knowing what to say to her without freaking her out. She said it was six thirty. I rested my head against the wall and closed my eyes...and then suddenly I felt this jolt. I opened my eyes and I was back in my own hallway, my head resting against the wall at the top of the staircase.\n\nI know in my heart that it was real. And logic would have a hard time trying to explain otherwise. Because trust me, I‚Äôm a master of sleep and know a lot about it, and such lucid dreams like that can only happen in the REM stage of sleep, which is where the body is paralysed (and that‚Äôs how sleep paralysis happens), yet I had supposedly being sleepwalking. The two don‚Äôt add up.\n\nI‚Äôve never been a romantic. I‚Äôm a loner who enjoys casual relationships, but the way I felt that day and the days that followed was like I was heartbroken. It was the pain of knowing I‚Äôd never see her again. I honestly do believe I crossed over to another dimension.\n\nThank God, my independent nature came roaring back not long after. And yes, sometimes I convince myself it was just an extreme lucid dreaming experience, but I don‚Äôt really believe that. And yes, on the bad days. On days like these, stressful times for everyone, I do find myself hoping when I close my eyes at night that I‚Äôll wake up in her embrace. Who knows, maybe one day I will.
