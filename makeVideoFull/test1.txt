Worked fastfood then became a teller worked my way up and 3 years later I'm a full time banker and now I'm interviewing for back office jobs (wish me luck please!). I make pretty damn good money and get good benefits all with just an associate's degree. Starting a bank job was the best decision I could've made despite it being pretty shitty some days, it's always better than managing a fast food place. I still haven't forgotten what that's like and will forever be grateful for my job now.\n\n\n\nEdit- Thank you to everyone wishing me good luck.
