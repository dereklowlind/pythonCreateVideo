To get a general idea of the net global production of oil our current estimate for oil in the ground  stands at 1.72 trillion barrels of oil , I am not sure if this is recoverable reserves or oil in place. \n\nI will make a super generous estimation that will overstate world oil generation, to show the imbalance. I will assume the 1.72 trillion barrels is recoverable reserves with a recovery factor of 35% that gives us 5 trillion barrels in the ground, now lets be super generous and say we've only found half the oil globally this puts us at 10 trillion barrels, now we extracted around 1.5 trillion barrels between 1950 and 2017, since oil consumption prior to 1950 wasn't anywhere near the scale it is today I will be generous and say 2 trillion barrels have been extracted over the history of man. Now that gives us 12 trillion barrels of oil in the ground before we started digging, It's taken 230 million years or 83.95 billion days to produce a net of 12 trillion barrels of oil, which works out at 143 barrels per day, and that is a huge overestimation.\n\n**edit** the over estimation means that in reality less than 2000-3000 americans consume more oil than the world produces per year, I would even hazard a guess that the oil consumption of Trumps golf trips alone is greater than the entire earths net oil production per year (as absurd as this sounds, I am literally not joking)","isChecked":false,"level":10},{"author":"another-social-freak","body":"Much much less","isChecked":false,"level":10},{"author":"Deadmeat553","body":"Typically the phrase \"fraction of a fraction\" means less than 1% of 1% (i.e. <0.0001%)","isChecked":false,"level":10},{"author":"ArcadianDelSol","body":"I once had this head of lettuce in the crisper drawer for waaaay too long.

That's kind of what I think happened, bear in mind I haven't really researched this much beyond a google search probably a year ago. So while oil does have some low percentage of dinosaur in it, the reality is that oil is mostly ancient plant and algae matter, as the mash of plants far outweighed the mass of dino's over-all.\n\nEdit: I changed coal to oil in a few places, because I apparently couldn't derail my mind from the coal-train.","isChecked":false,"level":6},{"author":"science87","body":"Yeah you're pretty much on the right track, but it wasn't all organic matter.
