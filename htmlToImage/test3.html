            <p class="paragraphstyle">Check out this talk from GOTO Copenhagen 2019 by Roy Osherove, author of "The Art Of Unit Testing" and "Elastic Leadership.Growing self-organizing teams". You can find the link to the talk, along with the full talk abstract pasted below: [https://youtu.be/goihWvyqRow?list=PLEx5khR4g7PLHBVGOjNbevChU9DOL3Axj](https://youtu.be/goihWvyqRow?list=PLEx5khR4g7PLHBVGOjNbevChU9DOL3Axj) They say that "you get what you measure", and we've all seen it happen. "We need to get the coverage up!" followed by people frantically writing tests that might not actually test anything. Coverage is up. Quality? Not so much. So what metrics can we use to drive the things we believe in? In this session Roy Osherove covers recommended and un-recommended metrics and how each one could drive our team towards a bleaker, or brighter future. **What will the audience learn from this talk?** * Leading vs lagging indicators and their value * What metrics can hurt your agility * What metrics push towards agility * Influence forces and why people behave in specific ways (and how metrics play a role)</p>
